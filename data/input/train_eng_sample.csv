Especially at 8 pounds. The base is made of plastic not wood, which I didn't know would be good quality. I can tell you Lieyang used a very good quality plastic on this.
Remember the old rotary telephone. With that kind of polymer that was indestructible....it's like that.
It's called Bakelite....... I believe .......
The metal build is done well. Nice and solid..
Had no problem getting it running.....Cut you wicks to size. Insert into the 4 reservoirs fill with alcohol...
Light wait about 30 sec to a min.....one turn.....and off it goes......used 91% alcohol worked fine....
Also well packaged used two boxes one inside the other.....
Very happy with purchase..........."

There is no way you will find a better price on this many colors, a free brush and tray anywhere...even locally at craft/hobbie stores. In fact, those prices are nearly double in some circumstances. I bought this for some odd projects like highlighting gun sights and the punch marks in my wrenches so that I can see the tool size easily from a distance or in bad light situations.

I have used these ENAMEL PAINTS since I think I was 8 years old and I am now in my mid 30s and they are still the go to choice for me for when I need durability and a quality job that I dont want to redo for a long long time. This is a quality set and you get a ton of colors and enough colors to make your own custom colors by mixing colors in the kit. Google it to find out what red and yellow make! lol

Anyway, great kit, great contents, great longevity and theres not much more to say. If you need a durable finish or want to paint something that wont rub off easily then these are for you. I love enamel....acrylic...ick!!!"

I bought this promotional set to paint small hockey game players. The paint is outstanding. Instead of using the enclosed solvent, I use my own paint solvent from the garage and pour some into a glass holder (like the ones used in restaurants to hold au jus or horseradish for your prime rib) The paint brushes on very nicely and smoothly, but because solvent evaporates very quickly from the paint brushes and on the model, try to paint your model just once and don't repeatedly go over the same area because you will lift the paint. Wait until the paint is dry before brushing it over. This is especially true if you want to cover up so boo boos. If you paint over another area before it is dry and set, the solvent in the fresh paint will lift the original paint off causing it to mix it in with your fresh paint, and voila, you just created a new paint color. If you make any painting mistakes, don't worry, solvent comes to the rescue. The paint will cover other colors usually in one stroke. Changed some color areas may require two separate coats. Be sure to stir up the paint with a toothpick before using. The gold and silver paints have to be stir frequently because the metallic flakes separates rather quickly. But once stirred, the metallic paint paints on evenly and looks very nice. I used only 1/3 or less of the paint in each bottle, so there are enough paint to paint several small model planes.

Although I wore nitril gloves will painting, if you get paint of your fingers and hand, take a clean brush and dab it in some clean solvent (of dirty solvent) and brush it on your fingers and immediately wipe it off with a paper towel. This will also work easily on dried paint. Wash your hands with soap and water and you ready to go out dancing"

While it may be for ages 12+, it was still something of a challenge for me as an adult. But not in a bad way.

First, the construction. I never once felt frustrated with the parts. There are some parts in this kit, such as the window frames and deck rails, which are very delicate and should be removed carefully. Fortunately they are laser cut so fine that there's only a few small points where they're joined to their sprue boards.

Some parts had extremely tight tolerances with their slotting (such as the chimney), but a couple of light passes with an emery board solved that problem. In fact, the tolerances were so good that for the majority of this model you don't need any of the supplied glue. The only places I would recommend glue would be the windows, stairs, deck supports (on the front under the deck), and the back door steps just to be sure. Everything else goes together tight enough that tension is all you need.

There were moments during the build that I thought it would come right apart in my hands, but it never did. Once you have the walls and floor together, it stands up nicely and you can immediately see the strength.

The instructions, while in both Korean and English, use written language sparingly. In fact, the majority of the instructions are all visual, using a pretty standard series that repeats: Find parts to use, assemble the first half, assemble the second half. When recommended, gluing is labeled on that step.

The only tools I recommend you have on hand for this are some fine-point tweezers (some parts are very small), an emery board, and possibly an Xacto knife. The knife is optional but may come in handy for some pieces that are stubborn to get off the board.

And if you're feeling adventurous, there is a hole in the bottom of the model for you to wire up LEDs. The one problem I ran into with this is that the plastic for the windows is tinted orange and is dark enough to knock down a 2x2 array of off-the-shelf LEDs to near nothing. So you might want to consider putting something with a little more punch inside if you're going to light it.

If you're looking for a nice challenge that will keep you busy for a couple of hours, then you could worse than try this model."

There aren't many worded steps, but the pictures were clear and detailed enough that I had no deciphering issues. Plenty of adhesive included; I had about 1/3 of a tube left. I worked on it for about 4 days--a few hours each day, including time for the adhesive to dry. The model is beautiful when finished and definitely worth displaying.

However, after examining it myself I decided to give it a try. Having thrown out the directions I went in blind, just using the movements, gears, and weights as my guide. And guess what? I did it! However I gave it 4 stars as the directions are incorrect with respect to the placement of basically every moving part. If you take the time to fit it together and test the gears to see if the turn, especially for the escapement piece which actually has different sized spokes that need to be fitted to ensure the top ticks and the entire piece works. A must have for anyone who loves clocks and wants to actually build the mechanisms from scratch! It is so worth it! I've attached a picture of mine and am in love with it. Although it only works for a short time due to the length of the weight, I see this more as a working model than a clock.

still. its a neet looking timer. notice i said TIMER. this is not a 'clock' as such. the description from the seller doesnt make this very clear and i my self thought it was a true clock. bummed out for a bit but what the heck, for $15 it seemed okay so the bummed feeling faded.

ive seen many reviews about how the instructions were in JAPANESE and they couldnt read them an it was impossible to assemble. my kit came with instructions in both japanese AND english and it took me about an hour to finish it and do the first test run. even if only japanese language was used, the pictures are clear and concise and there are only like 30 parts to the kit. so i dont understand all the difficulty.

now as to the actual working part of this kit.

as i said, its a primitive timer. upper face minutes, lower face seconds. load the little weight basket with coins or whatever (i used washers) and wind it up while holding the pendulum on top then let let it go. the weight drops, which drives the gears, which move the hands of the two faces.

you can use different amount of weight along with the adjustable pendulum to vary the speed at which it ticks (tho only slightly)

the 'counter weight' on the model (right side teardrop shape) is 'for show' only and serves no actual purpose so i left it off my finished model.

after much playing around with it i find that with the 'tabletop' stand, it will run for about 8 mins before the weight hits the table and thus, it stops.

i currently have it hung on my wall to give the weight rope more room to drop and it runs for almost 15 mins till it reaches the end. it does seem to run a little fast but still accurate enough to time simple cooking :)

i intend to modify it a bit with a longer rope, re-attach the counter weight pulley and re-thread the whole thing with ACTUAL counter weights (more washers) to give it longer run times.

this was a lot of fun and easy to assemble. works great (ish) and looks really cool. a little simple paint on the faces and a couple of 'washes' to age it a bit (see my pic) and you got nifty item sure to draw attention."

 This is a great value escapement / clock model. The pieces are substantial and easy to separate from the sprue. The instructions were clear, if a bit detailed. Assembly is more fussy than difficult, as close attention must be paid to the orientation of parts. Don't mix up axles; a ruler can be handy for identifying which is which as they are identified by shape (round or hexagonal) and length in the instructions. Also, make sure that your string is facing the right direction before completing assembly.

Once assembled, you'll be expected to provide your own weights. The weight carrier looks like it's set up for about $2 worth of quarters, but washers ought to work just as well. The black teardrop weight pictured on the right is ornamental.

The ticking action is soothing and this seems like it will make a great desk toy."

This is another great model from Revell. The kit comes with a easy to read but very detailed instruction sheet that includes photographs of the real plane for reference as well as suggested readings. The kit itself is very straightforward to build. The details are very good and you have optional materials to put on the plane such as external fuel tanks and machine guns.

The P-51, to me, is a classic US war plane. Second only to the F-4 gull-wing Corsair from WWII (which I also built, see photo). The Corsair was the first model I built since my pre-teen years, and that was quite a long time ago.

Back to the P-51 ... I had a lot of fun with this build. Not too many parts so I really tried to focus on taking my time. As with all the models I am building, I try to keep close to the recommended paint scheme but using what paint I have on hand. The pilot can come out and the canopy do open and close, and the prop turns. There were decals for two or three set ups, I sort of combined all of them.

I think that an intermediate would have no trouble with this - easy build but lots of fun."

Now his friends want to get in on the action too. I'd recommend this for any young person or those young at heart that want to flex their building muscles and learn a little bit about our history. Also the model is historically accurate and to scale and looks great (not cheap) once completed/painted. Would make for a nice display once you've done a few of them."

If, you are willing to sand off any little bits you make stick out when taking the pieces off the panels, and fit the pieces together properly. The only tight spot was connecting the wings to the fuselage. I was a hair off on the top/bottom wing and let it dry.... I would advise doing that all while the glue is still a bit wet. It did still fit together however it was just more of a snap into place. The reason I only gave four stars would be the decals. If you want to do the big beautiful doll version (there are two options) for an experienced modeler it probably would be fine, it was a challenge for me but isn't that the point?

Originally a Monogram kit, before they merged with Revell (no close relation to my family, sadly).
Details are good for it's vintage, and it is unfair to compare it to more modern kits from Tamiya, IPM, etc. It is simple enough for less experienced modelers, a bit of a challenge for beginners, but still good enough for experienced modelers (with room for extra detailing).
This issue is molded in light gray plastic, rather than the silver plastic of years back. Only a couple tiny bits of flash seen on unboxing. Decals are for two different aircraft.

They did not include the red stripes that you see from the engine cowling to the cockpit (bordering the green drab paint). I had to make them from the slightly curved lines from the other design (cutting them in half lengthwise, too, to get the right thickness). Very pleased with the end product though.

One thing to note, there really isn't an option of putting it together without the landing gear , if you want it to hang it up as in a combat flight. This is because the tail gear doors is permanently molded open. I suppose you could cut them off and then re-glue them in the closed position. Overall, a very nice model.

Get it and enjoy yourself with a timepiece! The P-51 Mustang was indeed a different breed of airplane. It was fast, for one thing; as it red-lined at 505 and, though it was no Spitfire, its turning ability wasn't bad at all - especially if you sneaked down 10 degrees of flaps. It was pretty good in the climbing department too, and accelerated very fast in a dive. But the thing that really set the Mustang apart from any other fighter, friend or foe, was its range. With a 75-gallon tank slung under each wing, it could perform the unheard-of: It could fly six-hour missions. Physically, it was pleasing to the eye and looked fast, even sitting on the ground. Power was provided by a V-1650 Rolls-Royce Merlin engine built under license in the States by Packard, the luxury automobile company. The V-1650 was a fine engine and could be taken up to 61 inches of manifold pressure at 3,000 RPM for take-off or, if needed in combat, 67 inches for up to five minutes in Emergency Power. Normally aspirated engines tended to run out of power as altitude increased, usually between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. The P-51 had a two-stage blower in the induction system that was controlled automatically with a barometric switch. Around 17,000 feet, when the throttle had been advanced almost all the way forward just to maintain normal cruise, the blower would kick into high, the manifold pressure would jump up, and the climb could be continued to 30,000 feet. The P-51 could be taken a lot higher than that, but above 30,000 feet the power was way down and the controls had to be handled gingerly. So get this piece for the enthusiast. Because in the maturing world during times of war, this machine lead history to be written in the books. Thank you Revell for keeping our ideas alive.."

Took it out of the envelope and the first thing that struck me was how heavy it was. I'm used to dealing with photo-etched bits, which are much finer and lighter. I realize these aren't the same thing, but it still (pleasantly) surprised me.

There is no ""flap"" on the package to open so just rip off the top. Inside you will find the separate sheets of parts, two in the case of this model. Also a double sided folded sheet of paper that are the instructions. The instructions seem deceptively simple. The individual parts of the model are not labeled on the metal sheets, only on the instruction sheet. Do carefully go over the instructions before you start fiddling with the pieces.

The instructions don't tell you how to remove the pieces off the sheets, which seems a terribly odd omission. The back of the package does state ""Parts can be easily removed from the metal sheets using a pair clippers ..."" though it fails to mention what kind. I use the Xuron 410 Micro-Shear Flush Cutter. Works great. The package does go on to say that tweezers are good for ""bending and twisting the ""connection tabs.""

I'm not going to get into the details of building the kit, other than to say you should take your time and not be in a rush. There are a lot of videos on YouTube of people doing step-by-step construction, some with just the basics while others document the entire build of specific kits. You should heck them out.

This kit is one of my all time favorites not because its a great build, but because I survived to conquer it! Many parts fit well, but when they don't fit well you are challenged with grappling and squeezing things together in such a way as to destroy the delicate delicacies experienced craftsmen drool over. As a result one is constantly bending and straightening, bending and straightening and breaking many of the same parts as fast as you can repair them. That's why I ordered another kit and after writing down sanity hints, I piece by piece grafted the second kit to the first kit thinking I was only going to replace a few parts. By the end of it all, all I had left over was what looked like a handful of blast debris, empty containers of several different glues and instant curing sprays, acetone, and four hundred used cotton swabs. After a month of building and destroying, ordering and waiting, grafting and repairing using my overly complete arsenal of photo etch kit tools I finally completed my master build. It was only after spraying the whole scuffed up project with ""wet look"" Testors High Gloss Clear Lacquer that my trophy looked gleaming bright just like it does in the promotional photos. I suggest the manufacturer make a larger scale kit with thicker pieces, maybe one that can be assembled using screws. (Did I really just say screws? OMG!) At least if the holes don't line up one can just drill a hole that does.

It's *not* packaged like some of the other Metal Earth/Works kits I've seen in retail outlets like Barnes and Nobel bookstores which are packaged in nice small white boxes.

This Lunar Module is in an odd scale, probably about 1/110 - 1/115 and stands about 2 1/2 inches tall when complete. It's a bit smaller in scale than any of the various Revell, Aoshima or Heller 1/96 - 1/100 LM plastic model kits. Completed, it will look exactly like the digital illustrations for the product. The Ascent and Descent stages are separate but designed to be permanently attached to each other. Obviously, there's some major details that aren't quite right (the windows are way too small, the thrusters too big, etc) and the fact it's a photoetch kit means some things like the tubes that comprise the landing gear are flat pieces that can't be rolled into proper tubes or cylinders but for the size and especially price, it's quite nice looking when completed.

The really good news is that it looks to be exactly the same scale as the rudimentary toy-like LM included in the (supposedly 1/100) 4D Puzzle cutaway Saturn V. With a little work and some scratch-(re)building some of the tiny fiddly details, adding gold foil to the Descent Stage and painting (I'd leave the Ascent Stage unpainted steel because it looks cool except the black patterns and some white antenna to paint), it would likely make a vastly superior replacement LM for the 4D display for a bargain price (about 13 bucks).

This kit's parts come on two small stainless steel metal sheets packaged in a slim paper package with two sheets of wordless instructions much like a small photoetch detail kit for trains or military model subjects. The kit requires above average skill with small, delicate photoetch/metal kits. Small needle nose pliers, a hard sharp hobby knife and some women's cuticle snips are the most important tools needed to cut the parts from the sheets and fold them. Assembly takes some patience and skill with tiny, delicate metal parts and it really helps if you are familiar with the subject beforehand. I would not recommend this kit for young kids and it is possible to cut your fingertips on small, sharp edges of some parts during assembly.

All parts are held together by very tiny tabs and you really need to think through the assembly beforehand or you will get stuck trying to bend a few tabs in areas not even small tweezers will get to. The wordless instructions are good for identifying parts but you have to guess at times how certain parts form into a complex shape. The hardest part is rolling the little thrusters into cones - basically I used tiny medical forceps and tediously wrapped and formed each thruster around a steel pen tip. I didn't do any part modifications aside from using thin rod for the main landing gear legs in the ""folded"" position as the photoetch leg parts are flat pieces and way to short (although my scratch built legs are too long, lol!).

My goal was to build it quickly, more as an experiment and an evening's fun than anything else. For my build up, I gold foiled the Descent Stage and painted the patterns on the Ascent Stage flat black with a brush as well as the two antenna dishes flat white. Because of the way the Descent Stage body goes together (top, left and right side of the body, two pieces for the bottom) I didn't even need glue to secure the foil to the parts, just bent the excess over backsides of the parts and putting the parts together holds the foil in place. I substituted thin brass rod for the main landing gear legs and bent the relevant parts to display the LM in it's pre-flight configuration to fit inside the 4D Fame Master Saturn V.

It's a fun little diversion and I'll buy a few more as I think some parts might be usable to accurize similar scale plastic LM kits."

Use shear cutters to do that. Do not drop the components. I dropped one of the small parts on a carpet floor and it broke apart from the bend junction. Some of the big parts are very fragile. Everything clips on to the big parts, so at least the big parts need to be sufficiently stronger. I bent a big component in a direction opposite to the designated one. I tried to bend it in the right direction and the whole thing came off. Now it maybe because my unit was defective or I just was careless. But I think that at the very least the big parts should be stronger. Things should not break from a 1 feet fall on a carpet floor. The way instructions are written, you are bound to break parts. Try reading everything first and come up with a sequence that enables building smaller components from tiny ones. Then clip on the smaller assembled components on to the main frame."

The biggest problem with this is the order they have you install some of the items, the thrusters for one are so tiny and fragile - for them to have you install them right off the bat then have to work around building the rest of the structure without knocking these out was a challenge. There were many other components too that I ended up installing toward the end to avoid bending/braking. The biggest challenge though for this was it has you right away bend the shape of the major section, this wouldn't be a problem except in order to install the other panels you have to open this back up. I ended up opening and closing this so much that the panel actually snapped off, fortunately with all the tabs twisted in the end you could never tell this broke.

It is an amazing model and I highly recommend this to anyone with patience, I do stay study the instructions first and ask yourself - is this step adding a small prone piece, if so can it be added later, and before I bend this will this inhibit me from adding another part without having to reopen it. If you do decide to do this I would also highly recommend buying Xuron 450BN Bent Nose Plier, 5 Inch Long Reach Needle Nose Pliers Jeweler Hand Tool, and Hakko CHP-170 Micro Soft Wire Cutter, 1.5mm Stand-off, Flush Cut, 2.5mm Hardened Carbon Steel Construction, 21-Degree Angled Jaw, 8mm Jaw Length, 16 G. These tools made it that much easier to bend the tabs in the smallest places.

One more note on these is when bending a part for a wheel or to be round, use a nail, pen, Sharpie, highlighter, etc to use to bend the metal around, this will help keep the parts in the round form. My first model I did, the Model T I didn't think about this and the wheels didn't turn out as well as they could've.

This model probably took me about 10 hours (I could be exaggerating here but it seemed like it), some of the other models such as the 747 took 45 minutes."

You will find yourself looking at the package as well as the 3D model view on the website to get a better idea of how some of the pieces fit together. I'm glad that I read the other reviews prior to purchasing on Amazon and putting this together, as my one piece of advice matches theirs: SAVE THE THRUSTERS FOR LAST. If you don't, you'll probably find yourself smashing them to pieces or bending them and other pieces quite often. Otherwise, this model looks great on my desk with all the rest, and is probably the most impressive. Definitely would recommend to anyone!"

Sadly, too many kits have instructions that oppose the builder instead of offering helpful guidance.

Well, I'm happy to say that this kit, in my opinion, is just another example of how kits should be done, and why Revell/Monogram kits are better than average. My one and only complaint is that despite having built over 600 models in my time, I was unable to get the kit's hood hinge to work. I finally just cut the hinge off and made the hood removable. Oh, and the hood is missing its air scoop. A 427 Cobra with no air scoop? Tsk tsk. Still, it was fun to build and it makes a nice looking dust collector on a nearby shelf.

But I cannot figure out how to upload them. Someone please comment to my review and tell me what I need to do. They are all .jpg's, under 300kb.)

I used to build model cars when I was a kid. On a whim, I bought this.

It has good detail, and the picture of the completed car looks fantastic.
This model looks harder to assemble than the ones I remember as a kid. It also requires a lot of different colors of paint.

 I have not assembled it yet. I will update my review after I get it put together.

Edit after Assembly-1/16/2017
 I was enthusiastic with the difficulty and the challenge of this model.
The detail is there, and therefore the potential to make a masterpiece is there. It is all up to the abilities of the person assembling it.
 For my first model in 45 years, I think I did well. I modified the paint scheme somewhat, adding even more detail, and I added plug wires. I hope I did well enough that the ‘real’ modelers are impressed. (Or at least I didn’t embarrass myself to them.)

 This is a VERY nice model car. I am giving it a low 3 stars based solely on their marketing this to young people. The box says 10+, and a skill level of two. It angers me when I think how many parents have bought this car for their young son (or daughter), and then to be disappointed.
 Yes, I see someone, much more experienced at models than me, has stated this kit is easy. And he has beautiful pictures of his car. But, he also says he has built over 600 models!!!
 This is not for your teenage child. This is not the same as the model kits that they sold when I was a kid. This is a model for modelers. It has over 100 VERY detailed parts. That age on the box of ‘10+’ is BS. A two in my day would be ‘easy’. This is no easy. This is about an 8 on a scale of 10.
 There are at least 14 pieces that are smaller than 1/4” across. If you sneeze, you could lose a good part of the model. All of these pieces need to first be removed. That in itself is a task. Then most pieces have to be trimmed, and painted.
 You will need additional ’stuff’. The box lists 10 different colors. I ended up with two different paint sets, and still had to buy an additional 4 colors. To make that pretty paint job on the outside body, you will need spray paint. After the decals are applied, you then need a clear-coat spray. You will also need one of those head worn magnifiers with an attached light.
 I spent over $100.00 for paint, brushes, and other things. I have provided a list of items I needed, at the end of my review, for anyone interested.

 Problems with the car itself:
1. Slight errors in the directions, but nothing that cannot be thought out.
2. Lower radiator hose cannot be installed as described. I suspect modifications could be made to make it fit. But it seems un-necessary, and I suggest not installing it. Then you can install the radiator assembly to the car body front, making a nice tight fit in the front, and at the same time making it possible to remove the frame from the body easier.
3. The tires are ‘quirky’. You will probably end up gluing them on. (I did.)
4. The hood will not work correctly. I found the problem to be a part of the hinge needed to be sanded down. And I also filed the notches in the body a little.
5. The decals are near perfect in length. But getting them to curve around sharp bends is hard. They could mention in the directions to apply a small dab of glue at the bends.

 The rest of this review is intended as advice to anyone wondering what it will cost to build this model.

After an analysis of costs (Amazon, with prime.), I ended up with the following:

Paint-Sets
 Testors Gloss Finish Enamel Paint Set ($22.87) This is a nice set that includes many other things you will need, including cement, sandpaper, a razor knife, and brushes.
 Testors Auto Detail Enamel Paint Set ($14.20)

Paint-Individual Bottles
 Testors-Steel-Flat ($4.30)
 Testors-Semi-Gloss Black ($5.93)
 Testors-Natural Wood ($4.63)
 Testors-Flat Aluminum (5.78) Flat steel and flat aluminum are near identical. Use either.

Spray Paint
 Red Metallic Speck-Rust-Oleum 251598 ($11.66)
 Clear Coat-SEM 13003 Clear Coat Spray ($16.39)
The professionals use paint sprayers. But that’s a whole another world that I didn’t want to explore for one model car.

Paint Brushes
 Virtuoso 15 pc Detail Brushes ($14.99)
 Solabela Montreal 24 pc Brushes ($9.99) (I think the cost has tripled for this item.)
I bought two brush sets because I didn’t know what I really needed. Both sets of brushes were very nice. I used brushes out of both sets.

For a total of ~$110.74
Cost, of course, will vary depending on your paint scheme, and how ‘detailed’ you want to be.

EXTRA’S
 Spark Plug Wire Set-Mad Modeling ($8.95)
 Pin vise and drill bit set, to make the spark plug wire holes-Pit Bull CHID B003 ($6.53) (Not very good quality, but worked for what I needed.)
 SHINEY Chrome-General Paint Chrome PDS-94 ($11.43) I bought a can of spray chrome paint solely for approximately one drop of paint, to touch up where I had trimmed the chrome pieces. For some reason, Testors does not make the ‘shiny’ chrome, in their little bottles. You can take spray paint and spray it into the cap, to get a liquid paint.
 Display Case-Illumibox 10004 ($17.99)
If you actually complete this model satisfactorily, you will need a case for it. Get acrylic.

About the paints listed on the box:
 Not Needed:
Gold - Only for the carburetors. Who paints carburetors gold?
Gloss Black & Silver - Not needed. In fact, directions do not even show any item they suggest painting with these colors. I had both, and still did not use either.
Wood - For Steering wheel, and gear shifter knob. They can be painted any color you want.

 Needed:
Red for the body.
Clear coat.
Ford blue (Dark Blue) for the engine.
Flat black for the hoses, mounts, strut/shock boots, interior, and misc.
Semi-gloss black for the starter, gear shift boot, frame, and misc.
Aluminum\steel for all the aluminum and steel parts. Side by side, the paints look identical to me. Use either.
Turn signal amber for the front turn lights. The rears are already pre-colored."

I realize that if model building were a snap to assemble, everyone would be doing it. In this model, some of the tiny parts were very difficult to glue on and to keep in place as the building process continued. It really sucks having to go back and re glue previous steps that were hard to do the first time out. Some of the components were a fraction of a grain of sand! Way too small to deal with. A surgeon would have gripes trying to fit some of these teenie parts and keeping them attached. The word ""delicate"" is an under statement when it comes to building this super small car. The car assembled is about the size of my hand. Some of the instructed building steps were not too clear cut and difficult to maneuver. Some of the pieces didn't seem too terribly precise as far as the molding process goes. I probable will select a different manufacturer for my next build. I will also try using super glue instead of Testors glue. I will also spend a little more in hopes of getting better quality parts to work with.
UPDATE: Car is now in the trash!"

Some part do not fit as they should. Lower radiator hose had to be discarded. There was no way to get it into place without cutting the front cross-member. The right-from wheel would not snap into place and had to be glued. Passenger seat will not fit with the handbrake in place. i had to file a notch in the seat bucket.

Order of operations should be reviewed as well. For example, don't glue the headers in place until you're ready to dry-fit the mufflers. Glue the headers in place, tape the body in place, then tape the mufflers in place and use them to hold the headers at the correct angle.

Revell also needs to rethink their sprue placement on chrome-plated pieces. I realize that some touch-up will always be needed but I have to believe that strategic sprue placement could minimize touch-ups and improve the quality of the product,"

I recommend painting all your parts that need painting first, then assemble your model so it has a more professional and clean look to it. The finished model looks great when you take your time and do your painting first (let all the paint dry completely) and then carefully put it together. Make sure you read all directions first and check to make sure you don't have any missing parts before painting and assembling the model. Overall, it's a great model."

I have been wanting to build one of these for a long time. I finally got the time to do it. I was very patient. I spent the first day, (about 6 hours) just trimming parts and looking through the directions. It took another 3 days, or so, to complete. Some pieces MUST be allowed to dry thoroughly before proceeding.
 Most of the parts fit very well. However, some pieces need to be ‘shifted/pushed’. Its wise to pre-fit, and understand how everything is going together, and, some temporary assembly is also helpful. The finished engine looks very good, with some mis-alignment where the water pump matches up with the heads; mostly caused by slight warpage in a front clear piece. Its minor to me.
 The box recommends paint. But I think that is an error. This model looks great without painting. Instead of adding detail and realism, I believe painting just distracts from the purpose of this model. (Having said that, there are exceptions. Some of the pictures other builders have uploaded, are impressive.)
 I used Canola vegetable oil, It seems to be working fine. You really need to be careful to clean the oil off the end of the rocker arm shaft, before gluing the cap on. And then work that closest rocker arm back and forth, to be sure no glue is stuck to it. (OR, just lubricate it after gluing.) DON”T apply oil to the cylinder walls. It is not necessary, as the pistons are a loose fit. The oil will just cloud up the view.
 I used Testors Clear Parts Cement where it said to use epoxy. I think the clear parts glue worked very well. It takes longer to dry, but it also gives you time to clean any glue from the threads, and you can even install the screw, and tighten the nut into the hole, getting it perfected centered. AND, it dries clear.
 The screws and nuts in my kit were nearly perfect. The sole exception was putting the screw through the generator bracket into the thermostat housing. I had to enlarge the hole opening a little bit, then it worked.
 It is a copy of an old small block Chevrolet. (Although, you can modify it to look like other engines.) If you assemble it correctly, the valves and pistons are in correct ‘time’. HOWEVER…some fool put the rotation direction on the bell housing pointing in the wrong direction. The engine actually turns clockwise…looking at it from the front. (The same as a real engine.) It doesn’t hurt to turn the wrong direction, its just that the valves work backwards then.
 It has great detail, and a lot of parts. I actually would have liked to have seen even more detail. Such as, a timing chain, camshaft bearings, a rotating distributor shaft, and a clear distributor cap. They also need to include spark plug wire looms. My pictures do not show them, but I have some split wire wraps on the way from Amazon. That should make the wires look better.
 Interestingly, if you build this correctly, some of the important items can be disassembled. You can add oil to the parts, or even swap out pistons, heads, etc.
 I don’t really see this as a great father/son project. This is a model you will need to concentrate on. (I believe this is the same, or very similar to a model engine that I tried to build 45 years ago…and failed. If my memory is correct, I gave up after messing up installing the nuts. I had them crooked, with glue in the threads. But, back then, we didn’t blame others, for our own failures, like I see many reviewers here doing.)"

I knew that this model is not an exact replica of any particular engine. It is Revell Visible V8. However, I've always seen it as a possible representation of Chevy 283 and by adding details like fuel lines etc and decals which are not included in the kit, it is my build.
Since completing It I ordered another and have just finished building it to represent a Ford 289. This required a lot of modifications as there are so many differences. This is one reason I have enjoyed this model engine kit so much: it is not an exact replica of any engine, so I can build it to represent whatever I want, build it and modify however I can and be proud to display it.
I had no problems at all with parts fitting etc. just the normal trimming and sanding.as with any good kit.

Younger children may be ok with adult supervision. This kit will fit together if you take your time. It does not just snap together. Styrene Glue, epoxy, a small file set and a sandpaper assortment is required. You must trim the flash, file down the ejection pin marks and dry fit each part before gluing. If you are skill level three, then of course you already know this. If you have built plastic model cars or planes before, then this kit should be no problem. If you are looking for a simple kit that can be put together in a afternoon, this is not it. Allow a few days of off and on work to finish. I got my first Visible V8 as a Christmas present in 1961. I have built five Visible V8s since and I am working on #6 now. There is a DVD available that gives step by step instructions for building the Visible V8 on E ---, if needed, however with some time and effort, these kits become a nice little model to show to all your friends. Please remember, this is a scale model and not a toy for little kids to play with, even though it is listed as a toy on Amazon. The Visible V8 is a great educational tool for that young future auto mechanic or engineer.

Important product update: May 31 2010. Do NOT use vegetable oil to lubricate your Visible V8 as the instructions tell you to do. Soybean oil will destroy your Visible V8. Unsure about other types of vegetable oil at this time. I would use Labelle plastic safe oil available from Labelle lubricants until a different type of oil can be found that does not melt the plastic used in the Visible V8."

Regardless, the way the manufacturer created all the parts I expected little to no REDESIGNING of parts. I quit building this 3/4 of the way once I realized I will never get the pushrods to actually function with the valves. The plastic camshaft bends the pushrods instead of pushing it up. The pushrods do not even contact the valve lifters.

On the brightside, this monumental project does look good after u get the cylinders in and watch the motion of components.

I will not recommend this to any of my peers for it is a doomed project from the start. Plastic components are just not made accurately nor precisely and will never fit together unless you make a living re-engineering a catastrophe."

As to be expected, everything is in metric and either japanese or chinese kanjis. They're tools and extremely self explanatory. The lack of English text is not a factor at all for this kit.

The only small detractor is the lack of a Scribing tool, but I haven't seen many kits that include one. I would personally have replaced one of the two sets of tweezers or one of the knife sharpening stones with a scribing tool if I were putting it together.

The words of my 9-year-old son, who pretty much put this together on his own. He has been fascinated with World War II for about a third of his life (since he was 6), and we even gave him a Pearl Harbor cake for his last birthday. As the school year is coming to an end, he decided that he wanted to begin putting the model together while I was out of town on a conference.

This is an excellent reproduction of the Arizona. The turrets of the guns actually turn. Although several of the pieces are quite small, the instructions are very clear. Although he did need some assistance from his parents when it came to putting the hull together, my son was able to do an extremely passable job on his own.

I have a Trumpeter USS Yorktown and its so good. At the very least, the box is rigid, so that shipping won't damage your model.

Wang",2009/07/22,"This model kit consists of over 100 pieces. The design is very good. Nearly all pieces are of reasonable sizes, so it would have been ideal even for beginners.

I say ""would have"" because the manufacturing quality is horrendous. Deformed pieces are common and feathers are everywhere. Trimming and in fact sculpting become a big part of the construction process, easily doubling the work load than had the quality been at Tamiya level.

Fortunately, the plastic is soft enough to curve with relative ease. There are no thin wires in the kit, so unlike the case with 05038 1/144 U-BOOT TYP VIIC RVL05038, breakage is not a big problem. Fitting large pieces together, however, can be a real struggle. I eventually use a lighter to soften the plastic into the right shape and end up having to buy a second set after ruining the first one. This is obviously not something that young kids should be allowed to attempt.

The documentation is weak and error-prone. The guns are not to scale. The design is of dubious historical accuracy. The main guns cannot maintain their elevations. But the main problem remains the poor manufacturing quality. If one can overlook or overcome this issue, the USS Arizona kit is a great project for novice or intermediate modelers."

This kit was nice for 2 reasons - it came with its own launcher, and there are 2 different levels of rockets to build. The taller ""Amazon"" rocket was much easier to build and took me around an hour or so to build (with the help of my 5 year old). The smaller one took a bit longer (plus the time needed to wait for the paint to dry).

Being someone who is completely inept at building things, I was able to build these rockets with very little difficulty. The launcher was very easy to set up and use, and after giving my boys a little instruction, they were able to launch them with me standing off in the distance. Of course they had a blast watching these 2 launch but even more fun chasing them down through a corn field once the parachutes deployed. As advertised, the ""Crossfire"" goes quite higher than the ""Amazon"".

After 9 launches of these 2 rockets and 3 other ones that I purchased at the same time, the boys were ready to go kite flying, but they are still well worth the money. Plus it's a great way for dads to spend time with their kids while building them and finally launching them into orbit!

UPDATE: After reading several of the negative reviews (which have nothing to do with the product itself), I thought I'd better add that YOU WILL NEED TO BUY ENGINES AND IGNITERS for these rockets. Also, if you want them to look like the ones photographed, you will need paint as well. Even though the product description seems self explanatory online, I understand that some smartphones aren't picking up this product description. All that said, still well worth the money even with the extras (which you can also pick up on Amazon for a fraction of the store cost)."

The Amazon was quite easy to build, with only some plastic cement, sandpaper, and a hobby knife needed - everything else is included. Some of the parts (threading the parachute and shock cord) are a little hard for small children to handle, but they can certainly participate in the gluing and applying the plastic cement and labels. I haven't tried the Crossfire yet, but I do know it will be a little more complicated.

The included launch system was what sold this for me, as without it I would have been unsure of exactly what else was needed to launch. I reviewed beforehand to make sure that I purchased separately the engines (with igniters) and recovery wadding, as these are not included in the launch set. These aren't expensive - but you definitely want to make sure that you have everything you need before building, as it's no fun to start a project with your kids that you can't finish. Mine tend lose interest fast that way.

Launching was easy with the instructions provided, and the boys (and Dad) had a blast. Even a hard landing in the parking lot didn't damage the Amazon. The boys (and Dad) are interested in building more (at least for now), so we'll try to get a little more adventurous with the next one."

 Part of the reason I give this product 5 stars is nostalgia. As a kid I built and flew model rockets just like these. But I couldn’t afford the cool launch pad and rod, so I used a block of wood and a coat-hanger that I had laboriously straightened. Worked great, and tons of fun!

The other part of the 5 star review is heart strings. These many years later when, my 8 yo son sat on Santa’s lap, the rotund old elf asked him what one present he would like to get from Santa. My son looked a little nonplussed to have to come up with ONE thing, but he gamely said, “I’d like a model rocket, just like my dad had when he was a kid.” Seriously? There was zero chance he wasn’t getting this for Christmas!

A few folks have given this set less than stellar reviews, mostly based on misunderstanding what they were getting. Model rockets are not toys and they are not preassembled. Model rockets are actual functional rockets. They require basic model building skills (measuring, cutting, gluing, and painting), and they require engines to launch. This is not a negative, part of the joy of this hobby comes with the building.

Here is a list of basic items you’ll need in addition to this kit to build and fly your rockets:
1) Good quality white glue
2) Plastic cement (the stinky kind) Cement Glue Value Pack Testors 2-7/8 fl oz tubes
3) Paint. Spray paint works well for solid colors, but enamel paint is great for detailing Testors Promotional Enamel Paint Set
4) Brushes Testors Nylon Paint Brush, Set of 3
5) Masking tape
6) Fine sand paper
7) Razor knife
8) 4 AA batteries
9) Fire resistant wadding Estes 2274 Recovery Wadding
10) 2 sets of engines

As model rockets go, these are actually very easy to assemble. Fins are usually the hardest part because you really have to be perfect in their alignment, but not on these rockets. The larger “Amazon” rocket has an injection molded fin assembly that just needs to be glued into the body tube. The smaller “Crossfire” rocket has balsa wood fins (*sniff* just like the old days), except these have been laser pre-cut for you. Even the body tube is pre-cut to accept the fins. Hard to go wrong.

Quick primer on engines. They mostly come in 3-packs. Each engine is single use, then dispose of. They are real rocket engines and they burn pre-loaded solid fuel. The designation (example C6-5) tells you everything you need to know about the engine thrust profile. “B” engines are twice as powerful as “A” engines, and are half as powerful as “C” engines. The first number gives the average thrust (bigger is faster), and second number gives the delay in seconds before the ejection charge pops the chute. Engines come with the required igniters, but not the wadding.

The flame resistant wadding protects the plastic chute from the heat of the ejection charge. Forget the wadding and your chute may melt, or even burn; not a useful recovery strategy! In a pinch you can get away with just using a regular tissue; it might smoke a bit as it falls, but will extinguish before reaching the ground. As a responsible adult trying to set a good example for my child, I bought the flame resistant stuff.

I used B4-2 engines in the Crossfire rocket, and C6-7 engines in the Amazon rocket. The B4-2s were perfect, but the C6-7s have too long a delay and gave us a heart attack as the Amazon rocket turned over and looked like it planned to become a lawn-dart - before the chute eventually deployed! C6-5s would be a better choice here.

My son loved launching these rockets! He was ecstatic when he almost caught the Crossfire rocket in mid-air as it was returning to earth. A video of his very first launch is attached. This little father/son rocket set is most highly recommended.

Edit: I changed my title to make it clear that this is NOT a boy's toy, it is not scary, and it is not rough and tough. Any kid with an interest in engineering, or science, or just going fast and high, would probably love this product.

Edit2: Youtube video of my son showing his mom how to use the launch controller and launch her very first rocket. Very exciting for the whole family!

You'll like the tall black one. Like gluing small fragile pieces together? The small white one is perfect.","dkniel",2016/07/20,"Got this set for my son's 12 birthday. Thought it would be a fun project together. We decided to do the smaller white one first and started a Saturday afternoon. An hour into it he lost interest and I grow a bit frustrated with the slow process. Between the instructions and the little fragile balsa parts, cardboard tubes, straws and cutting just the right cuts and making sure everything is placed correctly, it was a 3+ hour project. The next day we spend another 1-2 hours on the paint and decals and where finally ready for the fun part. It worked great, but a word of caution, start with an A or B engine with a short burn, unless you have unlimited space. We started small and everything was fine, but on the 3 or 4th flight we got a bit bolder and tried a more power engine with a longer burn. It blasted out of sight and we didn't see it until the parachute opened. Even with a very light wind it still ended up +1/2 mile away in a different neighborhood (best estimate as we never found it).

Fast forward 6 weeks. During the summer vacation, my son felt ready to try to build one himself. Less than two hours later he had the bigger black rocket completed and ready to launch. The difference is that the bigger rocket consists of just a few plastic pieces that are simple to glue together and they fit nicely and intuitively. Even the engine mount is simple and easy to operate. He had a great time building it and was proud to have done it himself. We went to fire it and it flew and work well. Again, the difference between the engines is surprisingly big. The smaller A engine was barely able to lift the larger rocket. The B engine worked well, but, of course, we had to try the larger C engine. Same result as the first rocket. Great flight but it went so high and came down so slow that we never recovered it (even a very light wind will carry it far!)

So, the headline is also the bottomline. The little rocket is great if you really enjoy the building process itself and the intricate work. The larger is great if you want to fire rockets. My son actually build a second of the larger rockets and did it, by himself, in less than 45 minutes the second time around."

The Astron II controller uses a 9V battery instead of the 4AA batteries that the product description tells you that you need. Also, you don't really need ""plastic model cement,"" I use Loctite Control Gel super glue and it works great.

I got this kit getting back into rockets after about a 25 year break. Didn't see the point in getting one rocket with a launch set when I could get two rockets for a couple of dollars more. I was really expecting to like the Crossfire more than the Amazon, because faster and higher is always better with rockets, right? Wrong.

I built the Amazon first, since I'm a crawl before you walk guy. Used the super glue for everything except the shock-cord-to-body-tube attachment. Used white glue for that. Total building/decorating time was about half an hour, checking the instructions constantly to see what I was supposed to be doing. This is my favorite of the two in the set. It's big, it's easy to follow as it accelerates, and it's easy to track on the way down. After the last launch, I decided that I need to cut a hole in the parachute to speed decent, because I have varying wind layers where I live. I recommend the C6-3 engines over the C6-5 just because I don't really like watching my rockets nose dive for several seconds before the recovery system deploys, shortly after apogee makes me much happier.

The Crossfire is a fun rocket. It goes high, fast, which is super cool. However, I've found that trying to go too high, too fast is a pain in the feet. I won't launch this rocket with anything more powerful than a B engine, because on every C launch it goes about 100' in the air and then careens to the side at about a 35 degree angle and I end up hiking forever to get to it. Which indicates to me that maybe C engines are too powerful for the stability level of the rocket. Every A engine and B engine launch has been straight as an arrow in the vertical realm, and I haven't gone more than about 50 feet to recover it.

As for the launch system, it's decent and does what it's supposed to do. I was hoping that the two-piece launch rod was a screw together contraption that I could take apart for transportation and storage. It's not. It's held together with a roll pin, so you hammer it together and it doesn't come apart with any sort of ease. Which wouldn't be so bad if the joint didn't leave an uneven surface for a launch lug to catch on. I replaced mine with a 1/8"" x 36"" music wire. When I get something that needs the ""Maxi-Rod"" I'll go to my nearest home center and get a 3/16"" metal rod for 1/4 the price of the Estes Maxi-Rod and it won't have a lip on it.

Update 9/9/13:
So I'm thinking that I may have gotten a bum set of C6-5 engines the first time. I had purchased two 3-packs of them, seperately for the different rockets. After the second time of chasing down the Crossfire I stopped using the C6-5s, leaving me with a leftover. Went out to launch the Amazon and lose some mini rockets and used the leftover engine. The Amazon went about 50' up then careened off creating a long walk for me. Intrigued, I decided to launch the Crossfire on one again the next week. The Crossfire on a C6-5 is impressive, as long as it's a good engine. Flight was beautifully straight, nearly out of sight. Make sure there's no wind and it's fun on C engines, I still stick to B engines, though, as I find them more fun with the better chance of recovery.

As for the launch pad, apparently it's not designed for 3\16"" rods. I got one and tried to install it to no avail. I ended up drilling out the rod holder about half way through. That way I can secure a bigger rod in the top part of the holder, and still have enough to hold the smaller rod."

This kit was perfect because it included two rockets - one for each of them. The smaller model reminds me of the one I had when I was younger. It was definitely the more difficult to assemble as it involved cutting out the wood fins an gluing them together. The larger model was a bit more modular - the fins are plastic and while you still glue then, they slide/snap easily into place. I would say the smaller model took 2-3 times as long to assemble - mainly due to having to let the paint dry before we could go to the next step.

The launch pad is also very easy to assemble. Of course, you will need to purchase Rocket engines separately. We tend to find the Estes engines at our local Michael's craft store. You can print off a 50% coupon from the Michael's website."

That said, the recommended engines ($10) do NOT launch the larger (more basic) rocket. Twice it flew about 20 ft in the air, then came down....laid on the ground....and out came the chute. First time I thought maybe I did something wrong but I didn't. 2nd time the exact same thing happened. The engines are just not powerful enough which, if not recommended, would not be Estes' issue.......but they were (or are).

The rocket itself isn't hard to build, but I was disappointed in the finished product. The tube is cardboard and you can see the cardboard 'lines' once completed - so we purchased some spray paint. Then the label went on - and its small. Doesn't cover like the photo would make it appear. It barely wraps around 1/4 of the body (the photo is take straight on so what you can't see is that the 'print' on the body doesn't wrap around any further than what you can see in the photo). Is that the end of the world? Of course not - but its deceiving and annoying as the finished product isn't as visually appealing as the photo would make you think.

The launch pad is flimsy and the rod has to be sanded (a lot) to make the joint smooth enough for the rocket to glide by without getting stuck. I do not remember this growing up. I get its only $25 but still......there isn't much to it as you have to assemble most everything and the engines are where the money is anyway ($10 for 3) so I did expect a bit more. I'll add a couple photos later on once uploaded....."

So cool when it takes off. Crossing your fingers that the parachute will deploy. Then running to see if it landed in one piece. My wife told me that she overhead my son describng our first launch to his friends as if we had set off an intercontinental missile.

Other items you'll need:
-A field! The instructions say ""500 ft square"". I think that's very poorly worded. It definitely DOES NOT mean 500 square feet and it doesn't mean 125' on each of 4 sides. They likely mean an area that is 500' x 500', or over 5 acres! You just need access to a very big area: the instructions say ""football fields and playgrounds are great"". Also, an area without other people, overhead trees, powerlines, etc. On a day without wind. The Estes and National Association of Rocketry websites have safety guidelines. I guess I've become the dad in bringing this all up. But finding open fields has become a bit harder where I live. Besides the safety concerns, if you set off your rocket in a small area, be prepared to be staring up at it lodged in branches.
-Model cement, carpenters glue, masking tape, fine sand paper, ruler, pencil, and a utility/X-acto knife.
-Engines and wadding: Amazon doesn't seem to always have these available in the sizes you need. The Estes site has a local retailer search.
-For painting second rocket, you can get spray white primer, white, glossy red, and a clear coat. You're going to be painting cardboard and plastic, so select accordingly.

Assembly: The nice thing about this kit is you can get out there with the bigger rocket pretty quickly. Personally, I'd assemble day 1 and head out for launch day 2. But you don't have to wait that long. My 9 year old hasn't assembled model cars and planes like I had when I was his age, but the rockets in this kit are pretty easy for parent & child to do together. The second rocket will need drying time between paint coats, so if there's that time when your child is moping aroud complaining he's bored, suggest you add a coat.

This kit is a great start. Keep in mind you'll probably have to spend another $20-30 on engines and supplies. The Estes website is great for resources."

Sometimes Amazon switches up the primary seller, and on this occasion it was a reseller who was more than happy to send me an awful quality bootleg for my $10. It was a 'Nano 3-D Puzzle' instead of 'Metal Earth'.

Anyway, the metal is hilariously flimsy. I can pretty much warp the entire sheet just by poking at it. And instead of being shiny and polished, it just has a cheap grainy look. I've already broke one piece just taking it off of the sheet, which has never happened with the official product.

I can only review the product I got, and that product has turned out to be awful, and I didn't get very far with the model until I called it a total loss. I wish I had been more proactive to raise a complaint about it when I bought it, but I was busy with work at the time, and the model kit just kinda sat on a shelf of a few months.

It's kind of a problem that because of pricing, sometimes bootleg resellers become the default purchase for some Amazon items, because it makes it a little difficult to avoid this stuff as a result. Looking at some other reviews of Fascinations products, apparently this isn't entirely uncommon either.

Best I can say is be careful of who you buy these kits from, and if you get something unexpected, don't wait to make a complaint about it. Certainly don't order model kits sight unseen like I tended to. Because I'm sure the actual official model kit is fine, but the kit that I got is of too poor quality to actually work with.

Great fun. Very detailed, beautiful to look at, almost jewel-like in the way it catches the light. Took about a week to build. The wheel assemblies alone took a few days to build. Reminded me of the plastic models I built as a kid, except without the glue and paint. It was a challenge working with the small parts, especially when you're getting older and your eyesight isn't what it used to be (and this was a painful reminder :-( ), but a magnifying work light did the trick. The instructions aren't perfect, so you have to plan several steps ahead on some of the assembly steps to avoid mistakes, especially on the suspension. For me it just made it more challenging and the end result more rewarding.

I would recommend starting with a simpler kit like the P-51 before trying this, but the Tiger was more fun to build and now that I've built it I'm craving more. The T-34 and either the Corsair or Fokker are next...

Warnock",2014/08/04,"I'm a modeler of scale wood ship models. I'm used to detailed work. This model challenged me in that department. Here are my ""Pro"" and ""Con"" comments -
PRO
1. Great kit - it's a photoetched kit and as such, is made of thin metal that is cut by laser. The parts are exact and fit well.
2. Results are amazing - fantastic looking with the etched camouflage finish.
3. Cost is ridiculously low. I am starting to work on photoetched pieces for two of my wood ship models. The photoetch pieces that came with the models were much more expensive than these kits.
4. If you are wanting to practice on photoetch before you do a model (plastic / resin / wood) - buy one of these kits, you'll practice, you'll figure it out and you'll become proficient!
5. Weekend kit - 8 to 10 hours to complete this kit. Spread out over a couple of days and you'll be tasked, relaxed, and rewarded. If you 'press on' and try and finish in a day or a single sitting, you'll feel frustration beginning to mount as you near completion - the wheel / axle assemblies are challenging to say the least.

CONS
1. Instructions - ""follow the numbers"" with no explanation. It'll take you a moment to figure it out and then you'll be on your way to completion.
2. Tools required - instructions say 'Needle nose pliers'. Perhaps a more skilled modeler than me could do it with a pair of pliers. Recommend an X-Acto knife with some #10 blades to cut the pieces out on a piece of glass or hard wood. Anything else will almost guarantee bent parts. You'll also need something to 'roll' a lot of the pieces on to bend them without crimping the material. I used small file handles, x-acto knife handles etc. to get the required diameters to be smooth enough to press the parts into the small slots.
3. Size - Hahahahaha - this is a SMALL kit!! I'm an old guy that models most of my spare time. I don't usually need a magnifying glass unless doing my 'detail' work. This entire model is 'detail' work. I spent the entire time cutting parts out, forming them, mounting them using a lighted magnifying light. If you're eyeballs aren't 20/20 - best get some magnifying glasses / unit with additional light...you're going to need it.
4. Instructions (second time!) - the axle / wheel / track section of the instructions are ridiculously inadequate. I suppose if you know how it's supposed to go together, you can do it, but the instructions are non-verbal just showing which part fits into another part - but if you get the sequence of assembly wrong - you're going to have issues. I'm at that point right now - not sure if I'm going in the wrong direction or not, but will figure it out.
5. Photo-Etch materials are precise - but you have almost ZERO opportunity to get a 'do over' - pieces that are bent incorrectly may break if you try to bend them in another direction, or if you try to 'undo' one of the assembly tabs..... check, double-check, trial fit, look ahead in your 'minds eye' before you do anything 'final' because you may not get a second chance. - If the instructions were better, it would make a WORLD of difference.

SUMMARY - for a photo-etch kit that offers superlative results, this kit is AWESOME and at a ridiculously low price!! However, due to the stated requirements of only needing a pair of needle nose pliers to assemble, and the kit being appropriate for ages 14 and above, I find it to be a disappointment waiting to happen. I would recommend that anyone with any detailed assembly experience could do this kit. You will need more tools than what the kit states, and some modeling experience, or detailed assembly instruction experience. This is NOT a 'gift' idea for a kid that likes tanks. It's a gift idea for a modeler with some experience and some tools and patience. I'll echo the other comments about the safety issue of cutting yourself with the parts / frame pieces - they're razor sharp - be careful. It's challenging and if you're successful, you'll have a fine piece to display. At the low cost - I'd order two of the same kit and use the first to practice and learn from and the second to build and display. They're THAT inexpensive......."

Do not give this to a child or anyone who has a short attention span or gets frustrated easily. They are fragile before you start building, during the building process and after.

The detail is amazing! It took about 8 hours to complete. It is essential to have the right tools (small needle nose pliers, tweezers, and I highly recommend a strong magnet for when/if you drop a small piece on a carpeted floor...makes life much easier to be able to grab it with the magnet). They are misleading only in the fact that these puzzles look easy and say ""just put the pieces together and bend the tabs."" It's a bit more complicated than that and in order to put them together in a way that will make them look good...it requires a lot of patience. At times the instructions aren't super clear and I have spent considerable time taking it apart some sections to make sure things align.
Also...there are times when it instructs you to twist the tab vs. folding it. I recommend folding the tabs first. It is easier to take apart if you need to when the tab is folded. Once you are 100% sure the piece is set, then twist it.
Don't be fooled by the 14+ age range. These are small metal models with sharp edges and require a lot of patience.
My fiance bought me a desk light with a magnifying glass, light, and small clamps to help hold pieces when I need more than 2 hands. It has helped immensely.
I also recommend a metal file for the pieces that don't break off smoothly.
With all of that said....I am completely addicted! I am working on my 10th one and I am constantly on the look-out for more. My Amazon wish-list is full of them.
One last thing---it is inevitable that pieces are going to break off at times (I'm lucky it has only happened twice). Bending metal can lead to breakage if doing it repeatedly. If I find I need to bend a piece more than once...I give it a minute or two between bends to let the metal cool and make it less likely to break. Because of the breakage, it may be best to buy 2 of the same (in case you break/lose a piece) AND if you are a perfectionist the second one may turn out better because you have practiced. I will be buying duplicates of my favorites.
These also make great gifts when they are completed.
Anyway---I hope this info helps someone who is starting out.
If anyone else has any other tips---I would love to hear them!
Good luck and take your time!"

Great way to work on your patience capacity.","avery",2015/06/27,"Cool tiny little tank. You definitely have to prepare yourself to be patient when building this, especially if you are easily frustrated. There are almost no worded instructions in the instruction set for this, just visual flow chart, and I didn't realize until I was building the tread that there are tiny arrows between one step and the next kind of showing you in what order to build, which is helpful seeing as if you build in the wrong order you won't be able to twist the connections tight enough and the model won't be quite right.
My tips: be patient, spend a few minutes staring at the instructions before even attempting to build, make sure you have very small needle nose pliers or something similar (honestly my pliers weren't small enough so I used an old set of plier style toenail trimmers, yes they were clean, to get into the tighter spaces, and when you are ready to build the gear looking parts of the ""tread"" build from the flat part out to what you see when it is all built. (Easier than trying to twist connections inside tiny tubes, in my opinion.)
This is the first model I have built, I enjoyed it and am glad that I found it challenging but not impossible. Have another on order now. It took me about 6 hours to build working pretty much nonstop."

Something to note on all Metal Earth models is that if you bend pieces too many times back and forth, they will break.

I would recommend a few things not in the instructions when assembling:
- A small pair of cutters, this will make getting the parts out of the sheets easier (all parts are in flat sheets of steel, kinda like a metal Airfix kit) and will also allow you to trim the small burrs after cutting out the parts, making closer fits between certain parts, like the turret and hull.
- An overhead desk lamp, something that can be brought close to your work surface and is bright.
- A hands free magnifying glass, or reading glasses. This combined with the light will make seeing the small tabs and slots easier, allowing you to make adjustments when assembling and making your life easier."

Directions are not awesome, but study hard what's there and you will be OK. The model is tiny and is shorter than my computer mouse. With patience, I would say an hour and a half to 2 hours might be needed to accomplish this. You will need small needle-nose pliers and a sharp razor knife.

The model isn't actually bigger when assembled than the simpler ones, just more complex (two sheets of steel parts instead of one).

If you haven't done one of these before, be warned, these are not puzzles, but rather small models. You need: needle-nose pliers (while some of them can be done with fingertips only, the Black Pearl is too complex); something round, like a pen, to roll the sails around; and the instructions (difficult to do in the right order otherwise). The results are gorgeous but fragile, suitable for display rather than for playing with.

The finished model is 9.5cm (3-3/4"") tall when sitting on the base by 10cm (4"") long.

Of these kits, this is my favorite based on the enjoyment in building the kit, the challenge, and the finished product (not to mention the cool subject matter).

On a scale of 1-5, I would rate the difficulty as 4. Generally the most challenging part of these kits are the pieces that require rounding or shaping. The few pieces that required rounding were fairly easy/straight-forward. The most challenging piece is the cockpit. If this is your first Metal Earth kit, this piece may require some patience to mold properly.

My favorite part of this kit is the detail of the finished product. The finished piece isn't simply a basic representation, but a fairly detailed one with a lot of depth and texture. I liked the recessed vents, fins, and raised areas that really added detail to this model.

This kit contains more pieces than some of the simpler Metal Earth kits, and it shows in the final model. This makes the construction more enjoyable. As with other reviewers, this kit also took me 3-4 hours to complete. I would disagree with the comment on twisting of the tabs by one reviewer. Connections tend to be much stronger with a twist tab join, so these can/should be used on areas that will not be seen on the completed model.

Regarding bad reviews by others: Be careful when reading the bad reviews posted by some. Some people blame their inability to complete this style kit on the kit itself. Don't be fooled, the kit itself is very high quality. The detail is superb, and the metal pieces are sturdy if you don't bend them repetitively (as you would if you made a mistake). Hence, I continue to recommend these kits to experienced builders with good manual dexterity."

the only thing not shown in 'what i used' (cuz i dont have one yet) is a hands free hobby magnifier. i WILL be getting one before i tackle my next metal earth kit...

for those that have never done one of these.

these kits contain INSANELY small parts. be sure your work space is free of clutter so if you drop a teeny part, you can find it again. (keep a flashlight handy...it helped me a couple times find a part that was trying to escape)

take your time! if you rush it. your probably gonna wreck it.

do not attempt to assemble these kits without the proper tools (see my pic) snippers, precision scissors, needle nose pliers, tweezers, and a variety of tubular objects to assist in rounding where needed.

mine is a little rough. but like i said, its my first attempt at one of these. it took me almost 3 hours...i saw a youtube from a guy who can do these things in just over a 30 minutes...but im in no race here...

the finished model looks really nice and it was fun to build. thats all i care about.

to clarifiy some stuff from 'questions' section. these models are made of steel. not aluminum. i suppose you could paint them if desired with the proper primer and paint. tho the model is so small and the detail is just etched into the parts. if you go slapping or spraying on layers of primer and paint...you are gonna lose all that detail. i would suggest an airbrush with the thinnest primer and paint you can use.

take your time. use some care. dont get frustrated. and your gonna have a cool model. good luck all!"

 SO COOL!!! I enjoy putting these together and have done about twenty of them, I am far from an expert and my first three ended up a wad of twisted metal, rage and profanity with a one star rating. There is a special way to assemble because these are not typical models.

TIPS AND TRICKS:

Don’t waste your time with the special tool sets or needle nose pliers (they didn’t work for me). I recommend getting tweezers with different tips. There are many times where you will be holding a piece with one set of tweezers and twisting/bending/inserting tabs with another and many times you have to reach tabs inside a small piece you have already made. Attempting to assemble this all by hand became impossible for me. Tweezer were needed.

Buy some really small, fine point wire cutters. The package says just pop out the pieces for assembly but when they are very small they do not “pop out”. They bend and just make a mess, so snip the points where they are connected and now they will easily pop out.

Get yourself some nails of various sizes to help transform flat metal pieces into cylinder shapes. I use different sized nails, cables, pens and markers of all different sizes to round some parts of these models. Whatever you use just make sure you can slide the model part off one end. Trying to round using tweezers is possible but doesn’t look as professional.

Don’t get mad if you break some pieces, just keep a small bottle of quick drying, clear super glue. I’ve broken many tabs and pieces. It just happens sometimes, if you fold pieces to many times it will break, read the instructions wrong and have to undo folding and bending they can break. Use small amounts of super glue and apply with a needle and you can hardly notice you used it once it has dried.

Some of the instructions are a bit unclear so look at the pictures closely and even the pictures of the next few steps. The directions are not very specific and won’t tell you exactly which way a part is meant to be bent, or engraved side in or out. Putting together a 3D model from 2D parts and directions can be confusing. Green triangle means twist tab and blue circle means to bend tab down.
If you get lost using their included flow chart, just know that the parts go on in numerical order.

You can see from my video that these are far from perfect but being able to complete them is a satisfying feeling. The rotating display is by Facinations and is solar powered. It works well indoors and works fine with just the lights in the room but do not work well in shady areas but it does take a battery if you want. Take your time, take breaks, have fun!"

Many times you can find a set of multiple models for a much lower individual price. Some are just harder than others. A few considered ""easy"" on metal earths web site have been harder than ones considered ""challenging"" or ""expert"". I like the harder ones. Spending $7 to $10 on a model that I put together in less than 20 minutes sucks. Having the proper tools is a must. A pair of small wire cutters (I purchased the Hakko CHP-170 for less than $5), a small pair of pliers or two (I purchased at Hobby Lobby in the jewelry section), a set of small electronic/watch repair screwdrivers (to bend the tabs or to take apart when I mess up), and since my eyes are not what they used to be, a head magnifier or cheap reading glasses you can get at any dollar store. I search around the house for things that may help. Round pencils, small wood dowel, markers of different sizes, anything that fits the shape I need.

Many of the pieces in the models are very small, and the tabs to be bent or twisted are hard to get to or manipulate. But isn't that the idea of a model? With all Metal Earth models, take your time and if something doesn't seem to fit then stop, backtrack, and look and see if you missed something or have a wrong piece in the wrong place. The instructions are easy to read, but on the more than 50 models I have put together only 2 or 3 have had an error in the instructions. I have learned that if you come to a spot in the instructions that is hard to understand then slightly twist the tabs. This allows for a much easier time taking apart. You can then bend or twist the tabs when you know it is correct. The tabs can be bent several times before they break (I can't seem to put together any of them without messing up and having to take a piece or two off to correct)."

First off, this probably was a poor choice for my first attempt! The Millennium Falcon was a bit more complicated than I was expecting. It still turned out pretty good looking, even on my first attempt and a few issues, which I will get to in a moment. It looks really neat sitting on my shelf, and unless you are reeeallly looking for it, you won't notice any mistakes (if you make them like I did).

That being said, some of the metal parts did snap off way too easily upon bending, making me have to go without a few components for the final model. There are bend-points on pretty much every piece, making it easy to follow directions. However, some of the smaller and thinner pieces just bent right in half and tore completely off, even with mild pressure! Be super careful when building it, and you should be good."

A: A person who remembers Revell fondly from their childhood.
B: People who are new to modeling who don't want to spend a lot of money starting out.
And finally, C: People who don't mind putting in a bunch of extra work to get a decent looking model.

If you fall into category C and don't mind breaking out the putty and rubber bands to get a decent looking finished result, then you've arrived at the right place. If you fall under category A, and you built this kit as a kid, then for you it's a labor of love and nothing I say here will matter anyway.

However, if you fall into category B, then I strongly suggest you save up your money and pick up a Tamiya model to get started with. I started out with back to back Revell kits, and was about ready to throw my paints away when I found a discounted Tamiya armor kit. After that first Tamiya build I caught myself saying ""So...this is what it's actually supposed to be like."" You have to remember that these are old kits. They are nostalgic for those folks who have been modeling long enough to remember when Revell was pretty much the only name in the game.

After I got a few Tamiya kits under my belt, I came back to the Revell kits. I'm glad I did. For the price you really can't complain too much, and by then I had a better idea how to deal with all the flash and poor fitment problems that come with these kits. I guess what I'm trying to say is that starting out with Revell kits very nearly caused me to stop building because I was so frustrated. That's why I have a hard time suggesting this kit for anyone who is just getting started. Now that I'm beginning to get the hang of it, I rather enjoy the challenge.

The Corsair is a fine kit, especially if you start out saying to heck with the folding wings and just glue them stationery. As far as Revell kits go I'd say this one is a bit better than I expected. Still, lots of putty, some cursing, and a few rubber bands never hurts."

Let me just say, I was seriously disappointed. I did a great deal of research before I purchased the model. I have some prior experience with Revell and some of their other models and did not get what I was expecting. The model is needlessly complicated, with some features of the model that I can only guess are supposed to work. The directions are unclear. The two halves of the fuselage and the wings mounts don't exactly line up, and will most likely need some serious putty or green stuff work to fill and look good. On the positive, it does look historically accurate and the scale is approachable to folks who may not have as much experience putting models together. That being said, I would not recommend this to any one who is new to model building unless you are ok with a model that is going to need lots of work for it to look its best."

The mold marks inside the fuselage still are stamped ""Monogram 1963"", but there are differences. The new kits are made in China now. The plastic is MUCH thinner and softer. The critical hinge pins for the folding wings are too weak now to properly support the outer wing. I wound up just gluing mine in the down position. I've lost some of the raised panel line detail while sanding the resulting seam. The landing gear struts are thinner than I remember. The tailwheel does not lock in the down position (see the box art and you'll notice that they couldn't keep it down long enough for the photo).

I will say that it has a medium difficulty (14+ years old).
In my opinion, it has more pros than cons.

Pros:
-It is FUN to assembly.
-You will learn about engines terminology.
-The manual is perfect (Pretty straight forward to follow).
-In 35 steps and 2-3 hours you are done. (I did it in 5 hours, but I was reading more about each part. I enjoyed a lot the experience)
-It comes with more screws than the ones you need, which is cool if you loses one screw. IT also comes with a magnetic screwdriver which is EXTREMELY helpful.
-It looks cool due to the plastic chrome parts that it has and due to the red LEDs light that simulates the ignition inside the piston chambers.

Cons:
-Most of the parts are stuck to more plastic (carriers frames), so when you cut away SOME parts, they come with excess plastic. Therefore, you have to carefully trim away any excess plastic with sharp scissors or knife.
-Does not come with batteries. (It needs 3 (AA) batteries).
-and the worst thing in my opinion... It runs SOOO slow, which disappoints me at the end.

BUT I JUST LOVE IT!! I had a lot of fun with it, and it looks just awesome :D

Recommendations in order to get a better experience:
-Read the first pages of the manual (Introduction) before you go to the assembling engine process.
-Before you go to the assembling engine process, skip the assembling steps and read from page 28 of the manual to the end of the manual where they explain in detail the basic principles of an engine.
- If you want, you can buy ""How cars work"" by Tom Newton, which explains every piece in detail you are going to use in this assembling engine process."

Aurelius",2017/03/16,"My small son wanted to learn about how cars move so I began to explain to him about how engines work, but he wanted to know more, so we ended up purchasing this Haynes V8 engine model kit. With the use of this model, I could show him how the pieces of the engine interact. I will elaborate on the model more as time passes but for now, I will say that although it does not replicate any one engine precisely, it is fairly representative of the modern V8 engine found in many sportier cars. I also believe reviewer Jerry Davis above does an excellent job of detailing the ins and outs of the model. His tip on spark plug timing is particularly helpful. the two distributors need to be reversed so that the LEDs shine at the correct time for each cylinder. The only thing I would add is that not enough screws were included with our kit, so I had to source them from somewhere else (they are Philips #2 screws that are 3/8 inch long for North Americans or M 2.5 x 5 for those living in the rest of the world). There is also an included jeweler's Phillips screwdriver that you need to put this model together (and it is in one of the later bags, so it is easy to miss).

I will also note that this model is for those who can pay attention to detail. The pistons, connecting rods and crankshaft all need to be carefully sanded when removed from the plastic frames. And every part needs to be pre-fit and rotated for testing before finally screwing it in place. If you do not take these steps and then wait until the very end, it is likely that there will be some tiny rubbing somewhere that will make the model not perform optimally. Attention to detail is very important for this model and is the reason why they recommend for youth ages 14 or over.

The model shows all the major parts of the modern V8 engine and does away with all the other systems that are not as important (like the ECM, the cooling system and the oil system). Even better, when it is finished, you can push a button and watch it go in motion for 30 seconds, with an engine start up sound. My small son took his time over two weeks under my guidance and we carefully test fit everything before assembling the next step. Because we were careful, our model works wonderfully. And this engine could be very useful as a teaching or home schooling aid as well. Five stars!"

I bought this to help education my son. Took us 6hrs to put it together. I gave it 4 stars only cause The distributors didn't seem to want to match the 4 strokes. Also the Cylinder identification is completly different from the real world. I suspect my dist. issue was caused by myself, but I reviewed the intructions several times. Swapped the distributors, and tried to tweek the cam timing, Ultimately, I found I can get close but rotating them 180 Degrees. As for the Cylinder indentification.. they are numbered 4321 (the right cylinder bank) and 5678(left back) front to rear, when viewing engine from the rear. Which is different from the standard. I didn't realize this untill half way though, and was relying on my own experience. That might have cause my dist. issue.
My son who is 12 was very happy with it. Is dieing to show it off to his friends. He loves seeing the spark plug lights. It uses one type if screw for the entire assembly. Which makes it less complicated for my 12yo. I would like to see a better intake/carbuator/fuel injection design. It's the only part of the build that seems to have fallen short of the assembly.

Oddly the parts are all inch and fraction dimensioned and all the instructions call them by their metric values. - like it was designed and made in the US but with instructions written for metric users.
I didn't use the clay - I was afraid it might leave greasy marks around. I found the best ""ammo"" to be some aluminum foil balls crumpled up tight to be about 1"" in diameter or a little larger. It shot about 15-20 feet. good for a family room or long hallway.
Grandkids 2 and 5 played with it some. It was accurate so I could hit them square in the chest repeatedly and they loved that,

I built the first one with some modifications.
1. I used wood glue instead of the included white glue.
2. I used thin hemp twine instead of the included white twine.
3. I sealed the wood with Tung oil after assembly. Doing this after assembly is required because the glue will not hold otherwise.
4. I moved the loop on the holding-chock to the top, away from the axis of movement. This made it easier to pull the cable.

I built the second one with the modifications of the first.
1. I sanded the wood to make it smoother. The sand paper included is tiny, so extra is needed for this.
2. I stained the wood with a light color (Minwax Golden Oak) and let it dry before assembly.
3. I applied graphite to the axles where they spin in the wood. I used woodless graphite 8B pencils. This worked far better than graphite powder."

High precision glue tips are a must. Micro drill bits and a pin vise are a must also. I use many different kinds of tweezers and clips to act as a third and fourth hands. Your work space should be at least 4'x6' for this kit, well lit, and with movable intense lighting. Magnification of all kinds will make assembly a pleasure. Most important, keep your work space clean, and be very patient. Sometimes all you can do is glue two or three things, then you must wait for at least a day for the glue to set 'hard'. Take advantage of your ""Off Time"" and read ahead in your instruction books. You can always paint something. Have fun, be professional, and proud."

Took me 3 weeks, not including the sails. My next model will be wooden, though!

Used Hammered Copper spray for the bottom and stand. Found a small shelf the right size for the stand and drilled out the logical holes in the hull and attached with couplings. I think this looks so much better than the included stand.

At 62 (woman at that!) I had to use a magnifier. Found this one on Amazon that worked perfectly (after a few adjustments, of course.)SE MH1047L Illuminated Multi-Power LED Head Magnifier

Thank you, Michael Larson, for suggesting to glue and winch the lower deck. This worked perfectly! (and probably saved me undue frustration).

The front rail was too flimsy and disintegrated before I could assemble it. Made my own railing out of wire.

I used wood stain on the deck to give it a more natural color. Looks more like wood.

The u sections of the railing were equally flimsy. Had to make half out of wire again. And many of the ones that made it during the roping broke during the rest of the construction. Perhaps one should replace these with a metal part.

There were not enough eyebolts. Had to buy brass ones.

The manual was a little off in places. Found myself having to put eyebolts in very hard to put places after the fact. Maybe read the rigging manual before to see if all the bolts are in place.

My boyfriend loves how it looks and now it displays beautifully in our living room."

Lots of detail and most of the parts fit well. However, I was very disappointed when it came time to install the upper main decks (part numbers 36,37,38). After gluing up the two hull halves I installed the three lower gun decks (part numbers 18,15,14) with no problems...snug and tight they were, but it worked. Later in the assembly, as I was attempting to install the three upper main decks, I found the upper part of the hull was too wide for a good fit. In other words, there was a heck of a gap around the edges of the decks. After a lot of time and work I fixed the problem, but I think with a little planning the problem could be avoided should I build another one.
At the very beginning, when gluing up the hull, I would run a narrow bead of 15 minute epoxy the entire length and then apply my clamps. Now, I would temporarily install the three upper decks into the upper part of the hull,(you can pop them back out when done) to ensure a good fit against the waterway. Hold or bar clamp the hull halves together until the epoxy has set up. I should think once done the lower gun decks will fit equally well, and if not, they are much easier to remedy. Keeping in mind, the whole process is to ensure a good fit of the upper main decks, which of course is what everyone will see once you're done. I hope this helps other modelers."

This is my second time around building the same scale model. The first time was way back in my younger years.

Make sure you have the right tools to build this model: Hobby knife, magnifier, sand paper, hobby glue, bees wax, pair of tweezers, rubber bands, clips, and of course paint. I would also recommend toothpicks to help with glue management. I spread a little glue on wax paper, dip the tip of the toothpick into the glue and place that on pieces/part to fuse together. Also different sized paint brushes, (some of the areas are really really small that needs to be detailed). Have notice the tread spools are now color coded to help with what type to use for the rigging.

Revell does give you the option to build your model a couple ways. And for those that are really into model building, you can make some of your own changes to enhance the ship. Have fun, but have patience. Tie, glue and let set before moving on.

The parts fit together somewhat loosely, leaving a decent bit of play in the finished model. Also, I had a problem with the propeller.

To prepare the strandbeest for the propeller, a shaft slides into the top of the body. Then the propeller slides over the shaft, and a rubber stopper slides over the end of the shaft to prevent the propeller from sliding off. The shaft in my kit had too small a diameter to fit snugly in the body, and as a result slid in and out freely. Almost immediately upon blowing on the propeller, the shaft would slide out and the gear on the propeller would disengage, causing it to stop working. The rubber stopper was too loose to prevent the propeller from moving and pushing it off of the shaft during operation, also causing it to stop working.

The propeller blades are held onto the propeller frame with provided strips of tape. The propeller blades have a curve to them and are quite stiff, however, so after a day or so the stiff blades pulled away from the tape and disconnected. This could be solved with some glue, but shouldn't need to be.

That was not the case with this one, and it makes an obvious difference. The plastic seems to be a thicker gage than previous kits and that causes it to spring back into a flat surface, even when mounted with adhesive to the turbine frame.

Because of this, they occasionally come in contact with the frame and pop off. A stronger adhesive may correct this, but as of the initial build, I have four of the five blades trying their hardest to jump ship. Another effect is that, with the holes significantly out of place across all 5 blades, the turbine is completely unbalanced and causes the model to shudder as it walks. This also makes getting it moving in the first place much harder than it should be. Most obviously, when it comes to rest, the turbine always falls back into the same position; indicating that one of the blades is quite a bit heavier than the rest. Looking at it, it appears nearly twice as thick as the others and is the one which most frequently pops off.

Admittedly, I just get these things as a matter of curiosity and not as a serious undertaking in model-making. That said, it seems the models got better in later versions; this being from 2010 and the biped a Dec. 2012 product.

Get this product to scratch that model-making itch, but be aware there may be some functional flaws."

I could get it to walk only with a blow dryer, blowing on the highest setting. That leads me to the other issue - the fan blades are weakly secured with double sided tape. The stiff plastic used for the fan blades wants to retain it's flat shape, but the blade holder has a curve in it. So, the tape is too weak to hold it to the curve, and blowing against the fan blades makes the blades easily fly off. I had to solve that by super gluing each fan blade. So far, that seems to work. I also had to trim one of the blades with scissors since it whacked against the body when the fan was spinning - might have been due to mounting holes that weren't punched in the right spot - the other blades have plenty of clearance.

Overall, worth the price, but be prepared to massage it to get it to work properly. I'm an adult and it took me 2.5 hours to get it working properly - around an hour to assemble (and I used a knife to trim all of the pointy edges as I broke them off the part holders used in the molding process) and an hour to fix issues and see if I could get it to walk more smoothly. A couple steps took a while to figure out, but overall, pretty decent directions. I don't think I'd turn it over to a kid without adult supervision - I think they might easily confuse minor steps, which could cause problems. Also, they might now know how to fix issues outside of the normal instructions."

The blades are a poor fit and following their instructions they will not stay on. Double back tape and it doesn't hold. They actually give you a full set of die cut spare tape because they know it won't work. Too bad.

Also, again the propeller, the shaft is way too tight to allow the propeller to spin on it as I believe it is supposed to do. Instead the shaft turns in the holes in the framework, lots of friction. No way you can blow hard enough, I finally tested using compressed air and got it to walk. Now I need to figure out how to make it work right.

Be careful when assembling. Test the sub assemblies for free swinging and if the bind, get out a magnifier and very carefully trim flashing. I took my time and had very low resistance when operating by hand. The prop implementation is a disappointment.

I've continued to work on this and it now works right but only after reattaching propeller blades. They stay on long enough to make the point and visitors are charmed, as I was.

Still, fun to build. Well worth the price."

This is a fun boat, but there are a couple of tips that might be helpful. The only directions are on the bottom of the box. Don't forget to look for the little bag containing the two cannons that install at the stern near the helicopter. Also, the directions describe two vents, one at the rear, forward of the helicopter, and one at the bow. These are to release vapor after use. I haven't seen the need for this, but you may wonder what those are for. To the rear of the helicopter are two sensors. Place your thumb over those and the remote will operate the boat for the purpose of testing. Otherwise, when the boat is in the water, the boat will operate. The remote has two controls, one for each propeller. Both forward and the boat goes straight. Using only one will steer the boat, however, one forward and the other in reverse will make it do tight turns. It's very responsive. Also, it seems fairly watertight, but I did notice some water coming out of the stern at those two sensors. So after I use it, I tilt it up to see if any water will drain. The battery does not have any charging indication, so I don't know how long it takes to fully charge. The directions say 5-6 hours. The directions also say it will operate for 20 minutes. I suppose that's continuous use, which means longer otherwise. I've played with it for nearly 40 minutes. There is no low battery warning, but when the speed begins to get slower, there's still plenty of charge to bring it in. I've not run out of range. It's quite enjoyable - a fun boat!"

I'm not a model builder. I bought this to assemble as a gift for a train aficionado who is not mechanically inclined. It took me about 12 hours to assemble. A few tips:

Get an X-ACTO #1 Knife, Z Series With Safety Cap and use it to cut the small sections of wood attaching the parts to the board. It's easier to see where to cut if you turn the board over to the back side.

Use a pair of Hakko CHP-170 Micro Soft Wire Cutter, 1.5mm Stand-off, Flush Cut, 2.5mm Hardened Carbon Steel Construction, 21-Degree Angled Jaw, 8mm Jaw Length, 16 Gauge Maximum Cutting Capacity to cut the toothpicks flush where required.

Some Mega Candles - Unscented Tea Light Candles - Ivory, Set of 50 work well to lubricate the moving parts. Sometimes I rubbed the wax on the wooden parts, sometimes I lit the candle and applied the wax (for the gears, especially) with a toothpick. Make sure you don't put too much or you'll clog up the works and it won't move freely. Of course, you won't need 50 of them.

Get some Tweezerman Nail File Collection Pack of Emery Boards, 5 Count to file the burrs off of the wheels and anywhere else you see a remnant of wood left over from separating the parts from the boards.

Sometimes you need to tap parts into place. Make sure to support everything, and make sure it's really aligned. Don't force anything.

I broke a couple of parts through carelessness, but was able to glue them back together with Gorilla Original Gorilla Glue Minis, 12 g, Brown. Nothing too serious. Just be careful.

It won't go very far when fully cranked up, but that's not the point. It's more of something that you look at, knowing that it all works.

If I built another one, it would probably only take 6 or 8 hours now that I'm more familiar with how it works.

Anyway, I hope he likes it."

He really likes trains and he's into models and legos and such so I thought this was perfect for him. It takes quite a few hours to put together. It took him 7-8 total. Here's his list of pros and cons:

Pros:
-everything is made of wood. It comes with the rubber bands you need and toothpicks. You do need a wax candle though.
-the quality of the wood is really good.
-the attention to detail is amazing. Doors open and close and it has gears.
-directions are clear.
Cons:
-when you pop the pieces out they need a bit of cleaning up as far as excess wood that he had to cut off.
-some of the pieces do not pop out of the sheets easy to where you think you might break it.
-the smaller pieces do not pop into place easily.
-we both agreed that under other circumstances we wouldn't pay full price for it. I just knew he'd love it for Christmas and I went ahead and got it for him. But just as a frivolous purchase it's not really worth it.

Overall, he really likes it. After you wind it and put it in the appropriate gear it does move! We just found it takes more winding than the instructions say."

It's a bit challenging but mostly just time consuming. You do have to be ginger when removing the parts from their boards. Do not force anything at any point! Learned this the hard way. But luckily it's wooden and all parts can be glued back together. My only real qualm with the design is that the engine is reliant on a single toothpick to hold it. I made the mistake of over-winding the engine and the toothpick snapped and all the rubber bands went flying back into the engineer compartment which proved to be a pita to fix. But ultimately i replaced the toothpick with a metal track pin so that won't be happening again. I suggest you also use something metal (or hard plastic even) and non-malleable in it's place. It looks pretty cool when it's finished and is nice on display. Don't expect this to be a show stopper in terms of performance as it covers very little distance even if you wind it up as much as possible. The amount of track provided is indication of this fact."

One of us had seen a video and figured these would be a perfect gift for our dad who is very mechanically inclined, a gifted woodworker and a lover of puzzles. Keep in mind that my father is in his mid-80's, is very detailed oriented, and has the patience of Job. Given that, here is our review of this product.

Pros:
1. My father LOVED putting this together. He texted us pictures has he progressed, He really got a kick out of assembling this piece.

Cons:
1. Piece are very small and weren't cut so that punching them out was difficult. My dad used a magnifying glass and X-Acto knife and patiently cut out the pieces. He said it would be very easy to break one of the tabs.
2. The materials of this product were not has good as the Ugears tram we purchased him.
3. In the end, it didn't work. My dad was really excited when he finished this project until he saw the video of how if was suppose to run. And believe me when I say, if it didn't work for my dad it surely would not work for anyone else. He said the pieces and gears were not cut correctly in order to have everything spin freely.

Note: Kit did not come with X-Acto knife, but it is needed.

If you want to purchase a Ugears product, don't purchase this one. The tram worked much better."

The pieces are laser-cut and come on flat wooden sheets that are about 1/4 inch thick. I didn't have any trouble popping the individual pieces out of the sheets. The directions are clear and easy to follow, which was the biggest surprise! I had a few difficulties with the axles, which is why I only gave this four stars.

Tips:
Be sure to put candle wax on all of the parts that have an axle (AKA toothpick). I also found it easier to place the axles in first then add the gears around them - they sort of click in, so doing the axle in the middle of assembling each wheel/gear makes this easier.

I colored mine with Bic markers and Copic markers. Both worked well, but the ink bleeds a little into the wood grain so practice a bit before you color your parts. Also make sure to color the outward-facing side.

For final assembly, you may need to make minor adjustments to the placement of the gears on their axles to get everything to work correctly.

In general, assembly takes a bit more ""elbow grease"" (ie effort/force) than I expected, but if you're sure to wax the parts you should be okay."

Everything else can be assembled by hand. Don't rush and force anything.

The only parts I had trouble removing were these tiny little ends that conceal the tooth picks. They give you extras for good reason. Lucky for me I didn't need them.

I did it once several years ago when my teenagers were young. Now I have a two year old and we were learning about caterpillars and butterflies so I decided to do it again with her. She was totally into the whole process and will tell anyone who will listen now that a butterfly lays an egg, then a caterpillar comes out, then the caterpillar hangs upside-down, then it makes a chrysalis, and then the butterfly comes out!

It's a fascinating process to watch. You may wonder how a company can ship live caterpillars without injuring them, but you'll understand when the cup arrives in the mail. The caterpillars at that point are the size of apple seeds and they are safely suspended in silk webs. They also don't move much at all that first day, so don't be alarmed by that. The next morning you'll wake up to find your caterpillars have somehow doubled in size overnight. And you'll continue to notice this day after day. They practically grow before your eyes.

Around day 7 (and I'm counting the days from the date of the arrival of the cup in the mail), our now huge caterpillars became very active and were frantically working at the top of the cup for hours. I had a feeling they were getting ready to pupate because of the sudden change in behavior. As expected, on day 8 they assumed their J positions and began to transform one by one. You would think it would take a while for a caterpillar to become a chrysalis, but it only takes a minute. It is so fast I was never able to catch any of them transforming ""live"". I would walk out of the room for a minute, go back in, and another one had transformed. So I recommend once your caterpillars get into position, keep a close eye on them so you might catch the transformation live. (If you miss it, there's a lot of YouTube videos where others have caught it.) It amazes me how they go from huge, super active caterpillars to small, hard as a rock statues in a matter of hours.

We did have some bad news though. At some point when they were getting into their J positions one of the caterpillars must have knocked another down from the top, and he was sort of suspended in a web in a j-shape. It wasn't looking good for the poor guy but there wasn't anything I could do to help him without sacrificing the other caterpillars. He did transform, but in the process fell into the food in the bottom of the cup and was laying there in all the muck. Normally you would wait a few days before moving the chrysalids to the enclosure, but I went ahead and moved them the following day because I was concerned for the poor guy at the bottom. I did as the instructions on Insect Lore's site said and carefully moved him out of the cup using a plastic spoon. However, his chrysalis never looked exactly like the others (it was oddly shaped) so I didn't have high hopes for him.

Days 9-15 were boring. After a week of seeing nothing happen, you start to wonder, ""are there really living butterflies in there?"" But nature is so amazing. On day 16 we woke up and a butterfly must have just emerged as he was just standing there next to the empty shell and hadn't expelled any meconium yet. (Note: when they do that, it's kind of scary. They appear to be bleeding to death. But it's supposed to happen and it's not blood so don't worry about it.) Within minutes the next butterfly emerged. You can tell they are about to come out because suddenly the chrysalis becomes transparent and you can clearly see the wings. If you look at my Day 16 - 10 AM photo you can see that the chrysalis to the right of the butterfly is almost completely transparent and about to emerge any second. The one to the left of the butterfly is starting to darken a bit, which happens about an hour before it turns transparent. The one below and to the left of the butterfly has not yet started to change in appearance at all. And the poor dude laying there on the bottom of the picture was our possible casualty.

Once you notice a change in the chrysalids' appearance, especially when they become transparent, don't blink or you'll miss it. I literally went and brushed my teeth and came back and butterfly #2 was out. So I got the camera ready when #3 became transparent and was able to capture the ""birth"" on camera, which was fascinating (my 2 year old, of course, loved seeing that). #4 ran about 24 hours behind the others and emerged just before we woke up on day 17. I was just amazed that after a week of ""hibernation"" 3 of the butterflies emerged within minutes of each other. It's as if they communicate with each other telepathically from the chrysalids and say ""ok let's get out of here!""

Caterpillar #5 (The one who fell while pupating) is a mystery to me. I thought he was a goner. His chrysalis never looked quite right. Then on day 17 after #4 emerged, #5's chrysalis started looking really bad. It turned this dark greenish black color and started oozing. It had a horribly deformed shape. We could see pieces of the butterfly through it, but it looked deader than dead. I let it rest for several hours in that state and saw no change. So I took the really sorry looking chrysalis out of the enclosure, considered it a casualty and planned to bring it out to the garden later. I was quite shocked when I went back into the kitchen an hour later and there was a butterfly on my kitchen counter. I have no idea how on earth a living creature came out of that rotten-looking chrysalis, but there he was. I was shocked. I put him in the enclosure with the other butterflies and he was walking around and doing ok. Unfortunately he has deformed, underdeveloped wings and will never fly. I don't have the heart to kill him, so I'm just going to let him live out his 2 weeks of life in the butterfly enclosure. Poor little dude.

Overall, this is just a really inexpensive way to entertain your kids (and yourself) for about 3 weeks and it will give you a new-found appreciation for nature's wonders.

Update: Just thought I'd add in here that our deformed butterfly actually lived a full and happy butterfly life (2 weeks) in the enclosure sipping oranges. I couldn't believe it!"

Note - Read & Follow the directions and everything will work fine. We were worried that our caterpillars needed more air or food, but we left the lid on the cup as instructed. Don't put a cup of water in the butterfly habitat, as the baby butterflies can fall into it & drown...use the dropper provided & sprinkle sugar water over fruit & flowers. They will gobble it up!

The second time two of five caterpillars arrived dead and the other three were dead within a couple days. I contacted Insect Lore regarding their live insect guarantee within the time required for the guarantee to find out what the process was to get a replacement. We sent several emails back and forth, and they requested photos of the caterpillars which I sent. I explained to them that I had marked the location of the caterpillars in the cup and they had not moved. They just sent back canned responses saying that everything looked fine even going so far as to refer to my order of ""ladybug larvae"" instead of caterpillars. It became clear that they were not paying attention to anything I said so I gave them one more chance to honor their guarantee and I received no further responses from them. Fortunately Amazon provided a hassle free return."

When I got them I was pleasantly surprised that all 5 caterpillars were alive. Even more surprising all 5 made chrysalis and all 5 hatched. Learned something new as well painted lady chrysalis MOVE when disturbed and even if they fall they'll still hatch and if they can climb something they'll not be deformed in anyway. 3 of the 5 did wind-up as tasty snacks for my chameleon. It was funny watching him hunt them down. I ended up letting 2 of them go since they are native to....everywhere in the US.
Would I buy again? Yes, but not for the price I payed. I spend a lot of $ on insects for my chameleon and while he did seem to enjoy these guys and it gave him something to hunt. The price is a little steep for 5 butterflies that might not be alive when received, might not survive to form chrysalis, might died during chrysalis stage, only to end up lizard food. At the end of the season when prices drop I may order again."

I would recommend this to anyone with little kids. It's a very fun thing to do with them. We have a butterfly garden to transfer them into once it is time, and then we will let them go. I plan to do this every Spring, for a fun tradition. It's also a great learning experience!"

If I had spoken to someone about growing some butterflies/caterpillars, I wouldn't have done it.
I got this as a cool project to do with my four year old. The directions gave a timeframe much different (faster) than what it actually happened. It kept saying it would take many days for them to turn into chrysalides, and then into butterflies and this happened in a matter of 1-2 days, which would've been fine, but the way I planned it was around our parenting schedule with my ex-husband. My son missed a few things by being at his dad's
In the end, we got 2 healthy butterflies, one never came out of the cocoon and the other two were injured and then died. Again, my son was away when they ""hatched"". Then I also had to explain the dead and injured butterflies when he came home...
These also came in a little sad cup, sorry, but thats as best as I can describe it.
I spoke to some friends, and there are other healthier ways to grow butterflies. We are not going to help save some monarchs and then release them."

My son is four and obsessed with animals and science, learning a lot from Wild Kratts. This product was right up his alley! We got the caterpillars quickly in the mail and followed all of the instructions, which are easy, we also purchased a butterfly habitat for the chrysallides once they began to form. The caterpillar container has all the food the caterpillars will need so you literally just watch them grow and grow until the attach to the removable tray at the top of the container. All of my caterpillars formed their chrysallides within a day or two of each other at which point we moved them into the habitat and waited for them to emerge.

One thing the manual tells you is to put something down under the butterfly habitat to protect your furniture underneath it, a warning I did not heed and maybe should have. I did not expect to see the blood that came from the emergence of the butterfly. It's not a ton but it is enough that it might get on something that shouldn't have blood on it if the surface is not protected.

My son had a BLAST checking his butterflies and caterpillars every morning. When the butterflies all hatched, allowing a good day for them to get their wings stiffened for flight, we set them free. I'm not a butterfly handler so we chose to wait and watch them fly out on their own, which was quite awesome to experience!

I would recommend this product and have recommended it to every person who is thinking about doing something cool and plan to do this with my kids every spring!"

He can't wait to make more of these models, and I hope they keep making more elaborate ships like this!

Nevertheless","AmazonDweller",2016/12/18,"I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with white & blue camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though."

It only takes about 5 minutes to assemble and the addition of sounds really brings this piece together.

I grew up on the 90's galoob star wars line of toys, the micro machines and action fleet series. In terms of scale, they are bigger than the action fleet x-wings but maybe only by an inch or so length and width wise. A downside of this is that there is no pilot, I hope they introduce some micro machine style pilots for these things down the road. I actually tried to fit one of my old galoob pilots in but they don't comfortably fit in the seat, though you can maneuver them in there. Also I'm not sure why they don't include a stand, I still give it 5 stars because of how much it reminds me of action fleet toys and the price is really great. Another minor gripe is the landing gear doesn't retract on the wings like the old Action Fleet toys did, but they are easily removable.

If you keep this in mind you won't allow your kids to try and crash this into a wall or drop it from a table and you will find this to be a very good product. The Skill Level required to build this is Level 1 so it is intended to be for beginners or kids with little to no experience with models. My 10 year old son was able to put this together in about 10-15 minutes without my assistance and he has only limited experience with building things. Once this model is built it is very durable and will be able to withstand light play by older children. The intended age group is 8 years so any child under this age will likely destroy this model.

Once this model is put together you will find that the attention to detail is very impressive. The fact that it comes pre-painted makes it look even more impressive. Pressing on the droid behind the cockpit activates the sound which is a nice bonus. The one big downside to this is that the rear landing gear do not retract even though the front one does.

Also worth noting is that the construction is almost too easy, even for a level one kit. Some may be disappointed that the building experience is so limited and so short.

This is a great kit for kids, because it starts them out in the realm of model building in an easy fashion. Make no mistake, this is simply snapping pieces together, but you still have to do it correctly by following directions. The sound effects are a big plus, and I love the fact that once it's assembled, it's sturdy enough that my 8 year old son can actually play with it. The detail and quality is very high, which I would only expect from Revell. The only nit I have to pick with it is that the tips of the laser cannons are not oriented correctly. They should be vertical instead of horizontal. It would also be nice if the rear landing gear was somehow able to retract into the engine housing instead of having to be removed completely for flight. I'm just waiting for them to disappear. Still, I do not think either of these is enough to warrant losing a whole star -- maybe half of a star."

All the colors on the box are there, finely pre-painted, except the black on the inside of the engines.

The biggest flaw is BB-8's gigantic (if detailed) head looming out the top of an otherwise sleek vehicle. I know it's partly a toy that makes laser noises, but two of the landing gear are detachable rather than folding so it could have a more movie-accurate shape. I wish they took that further and made BB-8 a small, white peg of a button rather than the most prominently visible feature. He's so huge, he's one size away from wearing the ship. As much as I'd love to watch Big Burly 8 go flattening entire platoons of Stormtroopers with his girth, he's out of place on this toy."

Let me address the two most common complaints:

Common complaint 1: ""These are not for kids""
response: No, no they are not. nowhere does the product imply it is for young children, and giving the product a bad review because your kids cant put it together is simply daft. In-fact the product description clearly states it is ideal for ""tweens"" and older. That's a bare minimum age of 10. And that's no guarantee that it's appropriate for your kid. Maybe your 6 year old has extremely developed motor skills and patience and this model is perfect for them, and maybe you are 40 and don't have the level of motor skills and patience necessary for these models, it all depends on the user, so don't give a perfectly good product a bad review due to user error.

Common complaint 2: ""these are made of flimsy, low quality metal""
response: yes, they are flimsy. no, the metal is not low quality. it's a thin sheet of steel, the product explicitly says that it is thin, ergo the end result is delicate. it is a model, NOT A TOY. if the metal were any thicker, the end results wouldn't look good at all. they are supposed to be thin. You cannot be clumsy with these models. you have to use the proper tools, have steady hands and pay attention. That is the challenge, and that is why finishing the model is so rewarding.

I'm usually not so combative with other reviewers, but after having such a good evening with a couple of these models, it irritated me that people wrote negative reviews on them simply because they had personal problems with them. They are well engineered, and there is nothing wrong with them. They look great on a shelf when you finish them and they are a challenge to build, especially with this particularly delicate one!"

The model is quite small and the metal can withstand a bit of manhandling but the assembly directions are cryptic pictures that are not very helpful in a couple of steps. I almost completed the model but one of the steps was not specific enough and directed me to attach the top wing to the almost-finished model before sub-assembling and attaching the rear struts. This made it impossible to connect the tops of the struts to the bottom of the top wing. From there, I was also not able the tail wings either. I gave up and threw it all away."

There are a couple of tricks to make it work. The most important is to twist the tabs after they are fitted into the slots. This helps prevent bending the parts that are being joined. The engine needs to be assembled so the longer belt side is positioned to the right when viewed from the front. I did mine wrong and it prevents me from attaching the braces for the propellers to the engine pulleys. Because the tabs are delicate, I can't disassemble the plane to fix this. I also assembled one of the wing brace boxes incorrectly and broke a tab when I disassembled the box. I was able to use some clear tape to hold it together after I mounted it to the wings. Not perfect but it works. The braces that the propellers mount to require that the parts where the tabs are (Not the tabs themselves) be bent to form a ""C"" to allow the propeller to be mounted. I'm 58 so lots and lots of light were needed for me to see what I was doing. A must have is a pair of needle nose pliers. I cut the end off of a tooth pick so I could use the flat end to push parts around but it may not be necessary for those more talented than me. In spite of the error I made that prevents me from attaching the braces to the engine pulleys, I have built a very fine model. It was very challenging but I was thrilled with the result and will be purchasing another model of a different kind soon."

This is a spectacular display piece. The Hot Wheels Elite will be a much better ""hands on"" display with more intricate cockpit details, but Jada Toys fits my needs perfectly. I have this displayed in a dust proof acrylic box, so no one will be opening the cockpit to look. Don't get me wrong, the cockpit has some nice detail- but, not as good as the promo pics that Hot Wheels Elite or Hot Toys have released. I'm a HUGE Batman fan and Statue collector. This is my first Batmobile replica. I'd rather spend the big money on figures or busts. I'm very proud of the piece in my display, and you really can't beat the value you get for your buck here!

The coarse screws attach the rear fender. 2. In the instructions (which is mainly pictures) the axles are opposite what it looks like. The short one goes with the back tires and the long one goes in the front. 3. Caution, when putting the bottom of the car on. Leave the back end loose so you can slip the brake drums on before tightening the screws all the way.

Generally, we buy a tub of the white, and then use food coloring to dye it in an array of colors. We never have any problem with the dye leaving residue or staining anything, and the colors dry beautifully. Since black is difficult to make, we bought a little extra black to make details this year. Interestingly, the Black Model Magic made by Crayola seems to turn everything black - hands, towels, etc. The black dye gets everywhere, and is not as easy to clean off as you might hope given that it's made for messy kids.

Bottom line: It dried fine, and was fun to sculpt, but messier than some of the other colors."

It squishes easily and destroys the area that you previously sculpted! It also does not dry as hard as other sculpting clays so some delicate pieces end up breaking eventually. An example is a smiley sun magnet with wavy 'Rays' that my daughter made. After a week or so the rays broke off one by one and now we have the Walmart logo as a refrigerator magnet! lol
The pluses are these.
No odor
No staining on work surfaces, hands, or clothing.
No need to bake - hardens (somewhat) with air drying.
Very nice vibrant colors.
To sum up - it's perfect for young children but older children and adults will get better results with Sculpey Clay."

It is feasible if you research it, but the roof rack will have to be modified, some equipment left off, and a ladder will have to be added to the right rear of the car, just behind the door.

This is a ""curbside "" model-that means there is no scale engine. Body details, plated parts and clear parts arte good, as is the decal sheet.The body detail itself is spot on and should easily convert into an ambulance or a hearse if you care to model one.Be prepared to do some sanding and filling.

Wheels and tires are incorrect fot the Ecto 1. It has big ""pimp"" whitewalls and standard Cadillac wheel embelishers-hub caps. Also, the clear parts ofthe emertgency roof lights should be a transparent blue, not completely clear as they come in the kit.

I got my model in damaged condition. A small semi circular chip of plastic was broken off on the right rear roof, just above the ""C"" pillar for the rear door, but I was able to fill it in with balsa wood, sheet styrene and body puty. Besides that, some of the roof equipment will hide this defect anyway.

The only real complaint is not with this model itself, but with Amazon . The nature of the complaint is that it is very difficult to use a gift card .Make this process easier to use, and I`ll be back.Other than that, everything else was OK."

Compared to the other astrays this one is my favorite, there's so much here in such a little kit they all can't stay on at the same time. First off at the time I got this I didn't know anything about gundam, and still I'm not one who knows much about gundam. This guy here just caught my eye and I just had to have it. This kit is awesome! The black it comes molded in is a glossy black and the gold is the normal gold that gundam has with most kits so this one I would defiantly recommend in painting it a better gold. This kit doesn't belong on the ground, the wings on this kit are big and awesome, for this kit to look its best I'd recommend to get an action base. Along with the wings you are given two wires to allow the points on the wings to shoot out but these wires don't do well unless you bend them at a high degree so they'll stay up. This model also comes with a arm mounted shield and a claw that attaches to the arms, along with two swords that attach to the hip skirts but these love to fall off. In my opinion this is an awesome kit, for being an astray that is asymmetric."

The side sword holsters are impossible to keep on; for some strange reason they don't really have a joint to snap them in and are instead just supposed to loosely hang there which never works the way it's supposed to resulting in them falling out 99% of the time. On the same topic, some of the parts don't fit together as well as they should; specifically many of the parts in the arm even after shaving them down a bit don't really sit.

The heels make this thing really hard to stand alone, and the wings make it flat out impossible. It's weighted in such a way that almost any pose will make this guy fall over almost instantly.

The gold plastic looks much cheaper in person, but doing the lining makes it look sort of okay.

Build overall was fun, and if you plan on getting it make sure you have a base ready because this is impossible to display without it."

Be any means, this is a personal favorite of mine and largely due to being an obscure Gundam and my bias appeal to being a female pilot (For the record, twin pilots - male & female NO SPOILERS~)

PROS:
+ This model looks mighty well on display.
+ Decent articulation
+ Lots of nice accessories - Sabers (by on its hips), the claw thingy, the blitz shield/rifle.
+ The gloss finish on the black plates/parts are a nice touch
+ Decent color separation

CONS:
- It is fragile and because of its glossy finish, it is easily scratched and messy fingerprint marks ruins its presentation.
- Too many stickers and for the record mostly the red parts. About 98% (If I remember correctly) that is red is parted by stickers.
- The gold frame of this kit is an ugly cheap looking yellow crossed with some kind of cheap gold.
- Its balance is a lost cause not only because its weight of the backpack/wings but also its heeled feet. An engineering flaw.
- Its not much of a brick for display but a piece of porcelain display - not meant for anything else. Action base stand is your best friend here.
- The packaging to this kit is less than to be desired. If it's being shipped at any point, the plates may rub and scratch each other.

VERDICT: It's getting cheaper on Amazon and this kit is more of a niche choice. If you really like this particular Gundam and you have some experience of painting and modifying a little, then it's an instant-buy. However, if you're the latter, you can leave this kit alone. The NG (Non-Grade) 1/100 version isn't much better than this and personally, I think the HG is much better than the NG 1/100 Amatsu Mina. The metal build... Well too expensive. This kit is getting four rather than three stars because of my bias of liking this Gundam. Otherwise, rightfully it is a three starred product.

In regards, I personally just painted in the red parts, repainted the ""gold"" plates into actual titanium gold finish, and repainted the black with the metallic black finish when I found a nasty scratch (After it was assembled) and lastly, a gloss topcoat to seal it. I don't particularly minded to go through this process but I have hopes that there will someday be a MG of the Gold Frame Astray Amatsu Mina Custom Re-2 released (I mean why not? The Red and Blue frames got theirs)."

(Plus: this review contains correction to kit instructions!)","D. Darnell",2014/01/18,"Edit: I decided to come back and add some information to my review with regard to issues with the instructions. Hopefully this will help others who purchase this kit. Our kit instructions and parts list indicate that the timing belt idler pulley is a chrome part number 30. Our kit did not contain a part number 30 but it did have a part number 41 (not on the parts list at all) that looked a lot like an idler pulley. Looking at photos of the kit it seems clear that the manufacturer is substituting this new non-chromed part 41 for the old part number 30. An addendum in the instructions would be nice but, if you get this kit and find part 30 missing -- just use part 41 in its place and all will be good. The other mistake we found was that the part numbers for the crankshaft and camshaft pulleys are reversed but the only-fits-one-way construction on that step made sure we didn't mess up.

I built the Renwal V8 with my dad (the motorized version with the ""working"" plugs) when I was a kid and loved the experience. Since Revell no longer makes the motorized V8 I thought that I would try this kit with my son (he's 13). We had a great time working on this together. I loved that the whole kit goes together with pressure-fit parts and screws. No glue necessary. I would have gone five stars except the engine has a tendency to seize every once in a while -- but I think I remember the old V8 doing that too.

One tip: lubricate everything liberally. The tolerances on most parts are good but, as with a real engine, there are lots of ""moving parts"" and that means opportunities for things to catch or friction to get the better of the small electric motor that turns the crank shaft.

With a couple exceptions, the instructions were clear. When we found ourselves puzzling over a step it was almost always a matter of us getting in a hurry and not taking the time to thoroughly read the written instructions as well as looking at the pictures."

The see through block and electrical motor moving the parts in real time was great for visualization but cylinder fitting issues did not allow for completely smooth movements and so the engine would skip where a cylinder would get stuck and unstuck.

However, even with that it was a great visualization for how the engine internals work. Obviously it's simplified with only the major parts being given attention and if you had enough time and sandpaper you could smooth the cylinders out but this really is only a day or two project and probably doesn't merit the work."

While it is smaller and only a straight four, it went together in about four hours completely assembeled by my 12 year old son.

It's also cheaper and easier to assemble then the visible V8. What I enjoy about this kit is it doesn't need glue, most of the parts are put together with screws and it uses an electric motor to turn the moving parts and has light up spark plugs which the visible V8 doesn't have. I do wish there was an on/off switch on the battery pack so you don't have to unplug it from the engine when your done using it. I might just build an on/off switch myself. This kit is basic when compared to the V8 but it still looks cool on my desk. I am having some trouble getting it to rotate continuously because it keeps seizing up and it makes a loud clicking noise. It could be something's not properly lined up with the gears so it should be an easy fix. The spark plugs light up properly with no signs of malfunction.

Scott Hatton",2013/11/03,"I bought this to build with my son and I would consider it a good buy for a father/son project. I am mostly satisfied with a few comments.

It didn't require any glue, which is nice, but the screwdriver that came with it was too weak to effectively screw in the tiny screws that come with it (it actually started to fall apart). I had to get out my own precision screwdriver to make get it together.

Also, towards the end of the instruction sheet it just seemed like the team just gave up due to time or budget and left out some pictures that would be helpful to those trying to build this.

Finally, the biggest problem was that the distributor that comes with it to turn the lights on and off was defective. Luckily I had read about this from another reviewer and shut it down as soon as the motor sounded strained and the lights weren't coming on.

You basically need to pull it apart and remove the plastic piece that rotates with a couple of ball bearings and a spring and place it back together so it rotates smooth. I don't know if they get unaligned during shipping or if it is just poor quality control. The center piece should rotate smoothly. If it doesn't you may have the same problem as me.

If you just want something that goes together without having to work through some issues I would buy something else. If you don't mind doing a little trouble shooting this is a pretty cool set."

Reinhardt",2014/12/31,"The engine is awesome. Tons of moving and intricate parts to assemble. Probably the most detailed model engine that I have seen. The issue is in both the quality of plastic a well as the instructions. Some of the steps were missing. I have lots of experience building engines so it was a breeze for me but I bought this for my son to assemble and would have rather had him be able to do it all on his own. The steps for the ignition timing say to mount the distributor with the wires facing up after you reach top dead center at the #4 cylinder. The object is to base your ignition spark to hit just a split second before top dead center as in a real engine. The problem is, when assembled like that, there is no way to adjust to do it. No matter how far left or right you turn the distributor, it only fires near bottom dead center. I had to remove the distributor and flip it over to where the wires faced down. After a slight adjustment, the timing was perfect. Initially having timing off that much in a real engine would cause the engine to backfire through the intake. Not a good lesson to teach. I also have a stuck valve because the plastic mounting plate is warped. Even more crazy is this company makes some of the best auto repair manuals in the world so I expected top-notch instructions. The plastic that they use is pretty cheap and warped. The manifolds fall off easily. I would still buy it again but just be aware of some of those things."

All was working well until he hooked up the batterie box to it. NOTHING but the sound works? The little DC motor will not turn at all on or off the model and the spark wires do nothing at all? All we get is a starting sound once in a while. This was supposed to be a learning experience in engine building and function, not a learning how to control your anger in frustration experience.

In the description of the model it says it's 10 inches long, well it's more like 7""( very small). The package says it's ""fun to do"" and ""easy to make"", it's actually far from it. The pre cut pieces of wood don't seem to fit right when you try to put them together. The Kit is actually unfinished pieces of wood that you have to sand, shape and mold to get them to fit right. If you could get away with paying the $1.99 and not have to pay shipping and if you would not mind finishing the wood working at home than it would be worth it. You also have to consider that the model is unpainted. That's another $5.00 or $10.00 for the paint. Like I said at first, if you want a good looking model that's truly easy to make, pay a little more and get a plastic model (unless you're really into wood working)."

I thought it would be smaller than it was. So I was delightfully surprised when it arrived and it was a nice, decent size. Perfect for a 4-year-old boy who loves the Titanic.

You should have seen his face when he opened it. Well, I'm sure you can imagine it. It was brilliant. For three minutes, I was the coolest mom on the planet.

This is great for any Titanic lover! It would be perfect on a shelf, on a desk, or in our case, so much fun for said little boy to put together and paint and then run around with and make fly, zoom across the coffee table, slide across the floor, down the slide, dive into the sandbox, run around the living room, bounce off his sister's, slam into walls, tumble across the floor, slam into his cars, be towed by his tow trucks, bull-dozed, ran over by his Monster Trucks, take a ride in his dump truck, and then he asked to take it in the bathtub. I could just envision it falling apart and swelling with water, and the tears that would follow, but it was $3. What the heck. I could buy a dozen for the tub if it made him happy. So in it went. Yes, it fell apart. BUT it didn't swell with water. AWESOME! He just had more fun gluing it back together again. He said that it falling apart was it sinking. ""Cuz, mom, the Titanic sank, remember?""

I'd suggest a water-sealant for water use. I'm going to try that next. Summer is coming, we'll open the pool... Of course now he has his eye on the motorized one...

All-in-all, we couldn't be happier with this purchase. The price is phenomenal! So, I highly recommend it for the Titanic lover in your life- and for those who like to put things together and paint them. Even if they aren't a Titanic fanatic yet, you could get it as a gift and as they put it together and paint it, you could teach them about the Titanic. An idea for homeschooling.

If you're on the fence, buy it, you won't be sorry."

He's made sever other simple wooden models and is very capable of building and painting them on his own according to the directions. This one needed a lot of help from me, though. The smoke stacks were cut at haphazard angles and of varying length, requiring me to even them up with a belt sander. The four pieces that make up the gunwales for the bow and the stern were just garbage. None of the pieces matched each other to make an obvious ""left/right"" fit and required heavy modification to make even the most rudimentary fit. Once attached and glue was dry, it required more time with the belt sander to make the pieces flush with the hull sides. The hull itself was badly dented and rough with a corner chipped off. There is no way this kit could possibly build the model shown in the example picture without some real, adult level woodworking skills. I wasn't expecting something museum quality, but asking for pieces to fit and be properly shaped isn't asking much.

The real cost of this is $25.00 plus 8 hours assembly time.

Make sure you read all the negative reviews because they are dead on. The pieces are cut wrong and it looks like they substituted a bow piece for one of the stern rails in ours. If you are considering buying a wood model of the Titanic it's probably safe to assume that your kid is going through a Titanic phase and can't get enough of it. Unfortunately if you're not careful this model can turn them right off. There is no excuse for the types of poor quality that this model comes with. I assumed that it would be made out of softwoods and was not going to be as durable (or costly) as something made out of better quality materials. But I did not expect it to be cut wrong. It takes just as long and costs a manufacturer just as much to cut a piece of wood to the correct size as to the wrong size.

My son's fascination with the Titanic has lead to him to want to read and experiment. I'd hate to see something as stupid as this frustrate him and turn him off. So I guess I'll just have to run out to Hobby Lobby and pick up some sandpaper, tools, etc and plan to spend a Saturday cutting and sanding all of the pieces with my son so that we can put it together properly and make this a positive experience.

Better to give the $2.50 to the Salvation Army than to this company."

The parts fit together somewhat loosely, leaving a decent bit of play in the finished model. Also, I had a problem with the propeller.

To prepare the strandbeest for the propeller, a shaft slides into the top of the body. Then the propeller slides over the shaft, and a rubber stopper slides over the end of the shaft to prevent the propeller from sliding off. The shaft in my kit had too small a diameter to fit snugly in the body, and as a result slid in and out freely. Almost immediately upon blowing on the propeller, the shaft would slide out and the gear on the propeller would disengage, causing it to stop working. The rubber stopper was too loose to prevent the propeller from moving and pushing it off of the shaft during operation, also causing it to stop working.

The propeller blades are held onto the propeller frame with provided strips of tape. The propeller blades have a curve to them and are quite stiff, however, so after a day or so the stiff blades pulled away from the tape and disconnected. This could be solved with some glue, but shouldn't need to be.

For this price point, I didn't expect super-high quality, but there are quite a few major problems with this model. It feels cheap, and several parts just can't be assembled as they are meant to be."

The bulk of the assembly process was pretty straightforward. Having previously built the bipedal version from a more recent Gakken issue, I was able to complete it in just under an hour. Aside from a couple misgivings on one or two of the choices made concerning the finishing bits -the rubber band and the functionally pointless wire shafts and ""stoppers""-- I was fairly pleased with it.

That is, I was, until I got to the turbine. This is where I noticed a lot of undercutting in the manufacturing process. A few of the blades had holes half-punched or not at all. Not to mention that they are out of place, as compared to the structure they mount to. In addition, previous kits have had the blades shipped with a predetermined arc already formed into them. That was not the case with this one, and it makes an obvious difference. The plastic seems to be a thicker gage than previous kits and that causes it to spring back into a flat surface, even when mounted with adhesive to the turbine frame.

Because of this, they occasionally come in contact with the frame and pop off. A stronger adhesive may correct this, but as of the initial build, I have four of the five blades trying their hardest to jump ship. Another effect is that, with the holes significantly out of place across all 5 blades, the turbine is completely unbalanced and causes the model to shudder as it walks. This also makes getting it moving in the first place much harder than it should be. Most obviously, when it comes to rest, the turbine always falls back into the same position; indicating that one of the blades is quite a bit heavier than the rest. Looking at it, it appears nearly twice as thick as the others and is the one which most frequently pops off.

Admittedly, I just get these things as a matter of curiosity and not as a serious undertaking in model-making. That said, it seems the models got better in later versions; this being from 2010 and the biped a Dec. 2012 product.

Get this product to scratch that model-making itch, but be aware there may be some functional flaws."

I could get it to walk only with a blow dryer, blowing on the highest setting. That leads me to the other issue - the fan blades are weakly secured with double sided tape. The stiff plastic used for the fan blades wants to retain it's flat shape, but the blade holder has a curve in it. So, the tape is too weak to hold it to the curve, and blowing against the fan blades makes the blades easily fly off. I had to solve that by super gluing each fan blade. So far, that seems to work. I also had to trim one of the blades with scissors since it whacked against the body when the fan was spinning - might have been due to mounting holes that weren't punched in the right spot - the other blades have plenty of clearance.

Overall, worth the price, but be prepared to massage it to get it to work properly. I'm an adult and it took me 2.5 hours to get it working properly - around an hour to assemble (and I used a knife to trim all of the pointy edges as I broke them off the part holders used in the molding process) and an hour to fix issues and see if I could get it to walk more smoothly. A couple steps took a while to figure out, but overall, pretty decent directions. I don't think I'd turn it over to a kid without adult supervision - I think they might easily confuse minor steps, which could cause problems. Also, they might now know how to fix issues outside of the normal instructions."

Dyal",2016/09/30,"Very clever design and this model does an OK job in most respects but the propeller design is not well implemented and that's a shame because the mechanism goes together and operates very well. The blades are a poor fit and following their instructions they will not stay on. Double back tape and it doesn't hold. They actually give you a full set of die cut spare tape because they know it won't work. Too bad.

Also, again the propeller, the shaft is way too tight to allow the propeller to spin on it as I believe it is supposed to do. Instead the shaft turns in the holes in the framework, lots of friction. No way you can blow hard enough, I finally tested using compressed air and got it to walk. Now I need to figure out how to make it work right.

Be careful when assembling. Test the sub assemblies for free swinging and if the bind, get out a magnifier and very carefully trim flashing. I took my time and had very low resistance when operating by hand. The prop implementation is a disappointment.

I've continued to work on this and it now works right but only after reattaching propeller blades. They stay on long enough to make the point and visitors are charmed, as I was.

Still, fun to build. Well worth the price."

I am puzzled by other reviewers comments about difficulty snapping pieces together. My 4 yr old grandson and six yr old granddaughter have no problem at all.

The pieces are larger than I remember as a kid. Good addition are the long bendable rods.

Both kids are captivated and is easily in their top 3 of favorite toys among some tough competition such as an Amazon Fire kids bundle. I bought 2 of the 200 piece sets and glad I did- fortunately they were on sale. Nice variety of parts though seems to be a disproportionate number of small, infrequently used parts- presumably padding the part count and the reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars."

The good:
-Versatile with many sizes rods and connectors that are color coded.
-Great open ended creative play.
- There's only a few really small pieces so my baby crawling around isn't in imminent danger while we're all playing.

The OK:
-200 is deceiving. Once it's all dumped out it doesn't look like a ton since many small pieces are included like a connector for 2 rods that's not always needed. You can't build more than one of the suggestions at a time which isn't compatible with showing off your hard work for very long.

-Speaking of hard work- the rods don't always ""click"" to ensure they're in. It takes some force and finesse for some of the pieces even for an adult. My 4 year old is getting a little frustrated and this isn't a toy she can successfully play with independently for very long, yet.

- Some of the pieces are pretty specific to one building option like the red grid (4 of them!). This won't snap two sides together unless it's a specific width apart so another example of really there's not as many usable pieces as expected.

I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives if you can catch this on a deal price and add another one of the sets."

Steen",2016/12/28,"This is the third set of TinkerToys I've bought this year, and I can't say enough about the fun level. Of course I bought them to play with my 4 year old grandson, but as soon as they saw it my 12 and 10 year old grandkids got right to ""work"" making the various models and proudly displaying them. With as many pieces as I have now, we often build identical cars and race them down a ramp. We've built bridges, a Ferris wheel, cars, planes, and many other vehicles and amusement park rides.
Of course it's fun following the directions, but it's more fun putting them aside and just challenging ourselves to come up with our own designs. That way you find out what works and what doesn't, and you get pretty creative designing ""work-arounds.""
The pieces are far more durable and easy to work with than the wooden sets of my childhood, when the pieces would swell with humidity and not fit together. Plus, they don't break when clumsy little feet step on them.
One caveat: they fit together snugly, and little hands might not be strong enough to pull them apart. But, hey, that's when Grandpa is for."

Was pleasently suprised by the quality","Obi Wan",2015/12/02,"?????PLASTIC WAS NOT A DOWNFALL?????

I was upset when I found out that Tinker Toys were plastic now. I wanted to get my kids the same great durable Tinker Toys I had as a kid. But to get the wood ones you either need to pay through the nose to get the 'classic' Tinker Toys, or you have to get off brands made in China that all have reviews saying the paint rubs off on everything and lord only knows what is used to make those unregulated paints that are coating the childrens' toy. So no thank you.

But to my surprise the plastic Tinker Toys are not a bad product. First off they feel very durable. They are not cheap junky plastic. They will hold up to 'kid play'. And they snap together so you don't have that situation where the rods fall out of the connectors. Additionally, all the holes and rods are the same size. So every piece fits together. I do remember on my old wood tinker toys that some of the holes in the connectors wouldn't be drilled right, and some of the wooden rods were out of round, so sometimes I'd have problems putting them together in certain ways. But with each piece coming out of the same molds, everything fits perfectly. (Thank you, Eli Whitney, for your contribution to society of interchangeable parts)

So ultimately I'm happy with these.

Note, some third parties are selling them for really high amounts. Be patient and wait for them to come back in stock with Amazon and other reasonable vendors. They should cost around twenty five bucks."

If you kids really likes them you may need another box as 200 pieces aren't that many especially for a kid like mine who likes to build things and not take them apart and then has no more pieces to build something new. Like K'nex and Legos, this set comes with a book of ideas. We followed these at the beginning but eventually his little imagination took over and was able to build unrealistic things.

Too expensive. I grew up with wooden ones that had a lot of pieces so you could build a lot of things, things that looked like real cars or planes, and they could be quite large.

I did buy a 2nd kit to get my kids more pieces to play with but then, of course, I consider it more costly.

Maybe some items are cheap, but all are fully serviceable. Overall, a good set of tools."

As to be expected, everything is in metric and either japanese or chinese kanjis. They're tools and extremely self explanatory. The lack of English text is not a factor at all for this kit.

The only small detractor is the lack of a Scribing tool, but I haven't seen many kits that include one. I would personally have replaced one of the two sets of tweezers or one of the knife sharpening stones with a scribing tool if I were putting it together.

All in all, it's a solid starting place for a modeling tool kit."

It's a very helpful tool for identifying the major bones and sutures of the skull. You can even take the skull cap off to reveal the cranial fossae: anterior, middle, and posterior. The spine includes all 24 articulating vertebrae that are named by their region: cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. Beyond that, this is just a nice desk accessory due to its small size (see customer images).

Contrary to other reviews, my skeleton is quite stable. I frequently move it around without the stand. I can hold it by the rib cage and shake it, turn it upside down, and place it in a sitting position without it falling apart. Just make sure that you have secured the pieces in properly because they shouldn't fall apart that easily.

Overall, I am very pleased with this model. It is very detailed, right down to the shapes and number of vertebrae. I recommend it for anyone taking an introductory class on the skeletal system."

If you are an anatomy student, you may need to stick to studying real bone models to learn the different parts of the bones because the model is quite small, but this model is still good to use as it lets you see how the bones articulate with each other. And you can also study which bones are left and right using this model with the exception of the clavicle (this model does not reflect the actual clavicle shape). It is especially helpful in letting you see how the ribs articulate with the spine however. This helped me understand the different parts of the rib and vertebrae because of the model.

As far as anatomical models go, this is a pretty poor example with some gross inaccuracies. Case in point: This model does not have thumbs. Granted there are five fingers on each hand, there are no thumbs per se. That is, where the thumbs are supposed to be are instead much longer fingers with an extra joint (the thumb should only have two, the metacarpophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints; the model depicts three). This is visible if you examine the image closely (which I apparently failed to do).

Overall, the pieces fit poorly and everything sort of sits off kilter. The skull and scapulae are disproportionately large and the curvature of the spine is poorly represented. As a ""learning resource,"" this model doesn't contribute anything over online images, videos, or 3D models. Something of this level of detail might be appropriate for elementary school or junior high school. I would consider it borderline for high school, inappropriate for collegiate student use, and wildly inappropriate for anything medically related (orthopedics etc.).

I'll probably end up using mine as a car mirror ornament."

I mean, it was kind of hard for me to see which piece was what. I am just old...LOL. He had a lot of fun and he did really love his Birthday gift! It might be a good idea if you have little ones to do this with the older child at nap time. He has made quite a few cool things and he is happy, so Grandma is happy!

The kids like to build projects, but the results are often so beautiful that we hate to dismantle them to provide enough pieces for the next project. There are instructions for several projects included in the box with this set, and, now, plenty of pieces. The difference in the instructions with this set and the others is that in the Maker sets, the instructions are laid out in steps, and with each step there is a parts count for the step. This provides a more efficient building process than looking at the diagram, retrieving the necessary parts, then discovering while building that we really needed, say, 5 yellow stars, not three. I put out small muffin pans to help organize the pieces. The little guy, 3.5 years old, is really too young to complete more than the very simplest projects, but he likes to build while his older brother does. We decided that since the box says it is for ages 7 and up, that he could be 3.5, and I would be 3.5, and together we'd be seven and could build the projects together."

My kids like to display their creations and I prefer using a clear plastic bin for storage of loose parts.
I also did not like that this set is more very tiny connectors and spacers than actual rods. As it is, I would need to go and buy another set with more rods to add to this one.

Watching my kid's eye/hand coordination progress while playing with Kinex has been amazing over the last 2 years. Highly recommended for kids that like to build stuff. A step up (and I say this lightly) from Legos in that the STEM features are much more intuitive, and I like explaining the physics of some of the design concepts and using the toys as a teaching moment.. Only drawback is that once a cool creation is made, it has to come apart to make the next one! Colors help keep the small pieces from the clutches of the vacuum demon (mother)."

I haven't assembled a model since I was a teenager. Like a lot of the reviewers, I experienced some challenges with the fit, confusing instructions, and difficulty gluing some of the parts. One thing I have not seen in the previous reviews is the mention of a flaw in the order of assembly.

The second major step is the construction of the fuselage, and the instructions state to add a small weight to the inside of the nose for proper balance. You then seal the nose cavity with Part 3. Later, you attach the tail assembly. This is the point at which you learn what constitutes a small weight. The weight I added was too small, and I had to cut out Part 3 to add additional weight. I would recommend waiting to attach Part 3 until Section 7, after you complete the landing gear, at which point you can best determine the required weight. Perhaps experienced modelers have the foresight not to follow the instructions, but for less experienced people who follow the instructions, it's a serious flaw."

I found myself trimming and puddying more than should be reasonable. I read in other reviews that this model takes some babying but let me insure you it takes a lot of patience and persistence. I fought and fought with the wings to get them to kind of be level with each other (and I am butt hurt that my wings are not straight). Other models have a much better convention for getting good looking wings. The instructions are bad (like some dude drew them, literally) and often times you stare at them wondering what and where it is talking about. There are thin pieces on the main body and wings that are very easy to bend off and break due to all the weird angles you will be gluing and holding it. Can this be a great model? Yes. Is it going to take a lot of work and frustration? Yes. It has been sitting in my room with a base coat for weeks now and I still hate the idea of messing with it. Never again, never again"

I wanted a simple, non-overwhelming model to be able to show clients during this explanation. I was so excited for my brain to arrive but was extremely disappointed with the actual thing. Most disappointing was that it didn't have the amygdala or hippocampus listed among the parts. Also disappointing was that the two halves don't stay together unless you hold them. The outside is gray rather than the bright yellow shown in the image, and it's made of material reminiscent of a dog-toy. I believe this would be good for children which is why there are so many positive comments about it, but if you want it for anything other than that, keep looking. As one other reviewer said (which I should have heeded and didn't), ""it's neither a toy nor an educational tool"". I certainly expected to get a lot more for the price."

-The glue dries VERY slowly. Like, perhaps 30 to 45 seconds for a good contact-stick, and a full minute to hold something in place that has a bit of spring to it (such as a part that doesn't quite fit). Do you want to hold each part of a 500 part set for a minute?
-You have zero control of flow. Because of how hard it is to squeeze, your options are one big drop or a squirt.

I was using [LOCTITE 1734231 1g Super Glue Liquid Mini Trio, Pack of 3pc, Clear] while I waited for this crap to arrive, and I immediately went back to it. The Loctite glue has a bigger applicator, but because the tube is easy to squeeze, you can get sub-drop sized amounts. It also bonds almost instantly, so you can move on to the next part while it really sets. Did I mention it doesn't smell? Do yourself a favor, use anything else but this crap."

I glued a couple sets together the other night and they were ready to be lightly played with within minutes. I did a little testing and they held together OK, then I let it sit together all night. The next day I put my puzzle in my pocket and went off to school. Mid-day I remembered the puzzle in my pocket and reached in, sure a piece had snapped off being in there with my huge key ring and dozens of keys all morning at work. Nope, they'd all held together. Great glue!

I had no problem cutting a small piece off the end and love the cap that I can put back on. It came with two small wires to clean out the applicator with if it gets clogged, but honestly I just tossed them as I didn't have a good place to keep them from getting lost.

A couple of the parts seemed poorly designed, and didn't quite fit the way the directions wanted you to install them. There were also a couple instances where the directions were either ambiguous or just plain wrong. One series of blueprints in particular told me to bend all of the parts on one of the late body panels in the wrong directions. But I'd still rate this 5 stars simply for the fact that the finished product is so utterly amazing looking.

Also, this being one of the more in depth and difficult models in the lineup, it'd be best to get some experience with these model kits before you try to tackle this one. And I'd assume most people who have experience with these kits know to look ahead a few steps, and to check finished model pictures to see what you are doing is correct.

I've made a few kits in the ICONX lineup, and this us thus far my favorite. It's really detailed, and it's built in such a bit at that it doesn't lose much at all from transition from real bike to sheet metal model kit. Plus this is the first kit of theirs that I've seen use a bit of color in the built. While not necessary, it's a neat addition, and makes a lot of the details pop.

The hardest part of the build, for me at least, were all of the tiny details on the engine block. Lots of tiny and fragile parts to put together. Once I got passed that, and onto the body of the build, things went faster and smoother. I actually didn't encounter a problem with the handlebars, as some reviewers mentioned, but I did need to use tin snips on a couple identical pieces, as their perforations did not go all the way through the parts that needed bent and folded. Not a big deal though, with the right tools at least.

And even though it says tools aren't needed, you should at least provide something to cut the pieces out of the sheets. My kit did include a free pair of tweezers, which us a nice inclusion that I've noticed random ICONX kits come with. So if you don't have a pair, this kit should have you covered.

Overall, in spite of some oddities and annoyances, this is a highly recommended kit from me. I'd recommend some prior experience before making it, but steady hands and patience could get you through it too, with some frustration. For its price, it's now a favorite of mine in the Metal Earth catalog, and well worth checking out."

I picked out a P40 plane, and then I realized I would need paint, glue, and knives, etc. When I saw this kit, it looked like it had everything when it came to tools, and it does. It has the Xacto (very sharp!) to cut pieces off the tree and trim flash - Sandpaper to smooth edges (great to have, I use the sandpaper to smooth pieces and they look better, plus you can rough up the surface for better glue adhesion), 3 paint brushes (small, medium, large) which will cover most painting jobs (however one might want to get a tiny, tiny brush for the faces of the pilot, etc.) - Lastly it has tips you put on the glue tubes, to direct glue correctly and to achieve smaller drops. Great to get your hobby started or re-started. I recommend getting paints and glue separately of course, but this covers your tools. I recommend this."

It is the only 1/24th scale replica out there in circulation that looks accurate. It's a snap together so it goes together in about 20 minutes or so, with no moving parts other than the rolling wheels. The rims are sprayed in silver and look really nice pressed into the black rubber low profile tires.The wheels do have strong metal axles. There is an embossed engine profile under the rear glass. If you're looking for a replica similar to the old style dealership plastic demos that they handed out in the 50s and 60s, this is the ticket! The quality of the kit is excellent. I used single edge razor to clean the flashing off the plastic parts before snapping them together, not really necessary, but I'm a perfectionist with this kind of stuff. The 2017 GT is truly an amazing Super Car that will go down in the racing history books for sure! I just had to have one to display on my desk at work and this kit works great for just that!

This was not designed as a ""modeler's"" kit, so don't expect a lot of detail, but it did have more detail than I expected (can't believe they actually had the buttresses in the body, I thought for sure this would be solid plastic!!!) I had planned to paint this model, but once I received it, I nixed that idea but for painting the interior and the engine (interior is not that visible anyway). The body is molded in the appropriate color and requires no painting (purists might note that the ""glitter"" in the metallic finish is perhaps too large for this scale). No detail on the undercarriage whatsoever. This model was designed for a child to put together and play with, though some parts, such as the axles and rear-view mirrors may require adult strength and dexterity. Mirrors are made of a softer plastic (think army men) than the rest of the model so they likely won't break easily but will bend. The body is relatively thick, and not the flimsy plastic that Revell uses for airplanes. I'm quite pleased with this purchase. FYI, Hobby Lobby has this model for $17.99."

Uh, NOPE. Manufacturer recommended age: 10 years and up. Are they KIDDING with this? I ended up basically putting the whole thing together for my older nephew.

This planetary system includes spheres representing the eight planets and the sun, sized in relative order (not to scale). It hangs from the ceiling as a mobile unit and includes special glow in the dark paint for added fun.

This solar system kit comes completely unassembled and part of the enjoyment for youngsters is the application of the paint. There are two strips of paint included with several different colors. This allows kids the chance to explore their creative side. Some kids will choose to paint the planets according to their actual color, such as painting the planet Mars red. Others will mix and match and create all sorts of different color combinations. Kids will enjoy this part of the process almost as much as they will enjoy looking at the completed mobile itself.

Once the fun of painting is over, it will then be time to assemble the pieces together. This is easily the most frustrating part of the process and depending on the ages of your kids, you may very well have to complete this step for them. The reason this is so frustrating is because of the very small size of the hooks and the rectangular pieces that are anchored into the spheres. The tiny hooks and even tinier rectangular pieces have a small hole in the middle through which you have to thread the fishing line. This takes time and patience and you have to tie the ends securely enough that the line won't come loose. A single knot isn't good enough. You need to make two knots if you want the line to stay in place. The pieces are so tiny, many young children will be unable to complete the task and even many adults will grow frustrated. The manufacturer should rethink this aspect and, if nothing else, increase the size of these pieces, in order to make them easier to work with.

Another possible trouble spot with this solar system module is the fragility of the pieces. The mobile looks interesting hanging from the ceiling and its lightweight design means it will slowly turn, with the slightest amount of air. However, because the pieces are so light and fragile, you have to keep the mobile away from wind/air sources. The air movement from a fan, for example, could be enough to make the planetary bodies come apart and/or cause the nylon string to become untied. Even the air movement from a heat duct could be enough to cause problems. It's best to place the mobile far out of the reach of small children. If little ones can easily touch the mobile, the constant handling will cause the pieces to fall apart.

Taken as a whole, the 3D Solar System Kit by Toysmith is still good educational toy for kids that introduces them to the world of astronomy. Assembling the tiny pieces can really try your patience and the fragile nature of this mobile solar system limits its quality. However, it still has enough positive points to earn a slight recommendation."

We painted and partially assembled it together during a couple of afternoons, then I strung it together by myself. It's definitely not a project they could do on their own, but it was fine with an adult helping -- as long as the adult isn't too picky about the end product! Overall it was relatively simple and the directions were good enough.

Pros:
* Sufficient paint. We did though run out of some colors -- don't expect to use the same color on several planets.
* Easy to snap the planets together -- and pull them apart again if needed. Kids did the painting and snapping together themselves, once I showed them how to align the pieces correctly (so the two halves of the hole for the hangar pieces line up).
* Plenty of fishing line for hanging, though you won't think so when you first see it.
* Assembly is easy enough, though still enough challenge for an older kid to enjoy. I did have to map it all out on the table before starting to string them on the support pieces, since the planets are close enough in size that it's not easy to tell them apart.

Cons:
* I was surprised to see that the unpainted planets were a dark blue plastic -- most paint colors covered it OK, though needing a bit more than they would otherwise for coverage, but getting a light color meant first ""priming"" it with white.
* Barely enough glow paint, and it doesn't glow much. It does if you shine a bright light directly on it for a few minutes, and then make the room really dark. But since it's a mobile, most kids' bedrooms aren't going to have a bright light *under* it. And having one over it simply makes the top of the planets glow -- which you can't see unless you're really tall.

Another minor problem I ran into is that the assembly instructions showing where on each hangar to hang each planet are only in centimeters. I couldn't find a ruler anywhere in my house with metric on it so I had to pull out the calculator and convert to inches. I won't deduct any stars for that, since I'd rather the US went metric anyway, and I have no good excuse for not having a dual-system ruler in the house. But be forewarned.

Liked, it and would buy it again."

It was perfect for our needs as an elementary home school family. My first grader loved it and was able to learn from the 3D, hands-on experience. There's no better way to learn an abstract concept. I snapped the planets together and sanded them slightly with the sandpaper square to ""rough them up"" before painting, as suggested. My seven-year-old and I snapped them into position on the model and then painted them together. The paint adhered to the planets very well. The glow paint didn't work well when we mixed it with other paints, but it did work well on the planets that we applied it to as a top layer (just a little FYI). This model is very small, but that works well for us. Just for reference, the ""sun"" is about the size of a ping pong ball. Jupiter is about the size of a giant marble, maybe a bit larger. The planets and distances between are not to scale but served our purpose well. We were wanting to learn about orbits, positions of the planets, and sequence from the sun. The only thing I would have liked to change was the fact that the set doesn't include Pluto. Yes, I know it's no longer considered a planet as it is now considered a ""dwarf planet"". Still, I would've liked to have it in the set."

That was my favorite part. I love crafts and I love art, so this item was perfect. I didn't mind the limited amount of colors and the fact that I had to mix colors to make certain colors. I really enjoyed putting this together for our son. And he really loves looking at it. He's always reaching up towards it wanting to touch it. Every time I go into the room with him, I tell him the names of the planets in their order and I point to them so he could know. The ONLY thing that I didn't like was that it shows Venus as blue when it is in fact known for being yellow due to the dust and gas. Luckily, I knew the colors of the planets, so I could correct that myself. I just hope that other people look them up online or something before they follow the guidelines given."

First let me say that this is NOT a toy. This is not something to be played with like you would a car or Barbie. This is an education toy that sits and waits till you need to use it for school. this is what I bought it for and this is what it was manufactured for.

Second, the parts are smaller then I thought they would be, BUT, not so small that my 8 year old could not handle it. I do recommend you use your own paint brushes. You know how these children kits are, the brush is so huge that there is no way you can do any detail work. I happen to have a brush set for my child and we just used that.

Lastly, I think this was well worth the money. We were going to put together one of those Styrofoam ball solar systems, but this is WAY better! It is not hanging from my ceiling and it comes to the table every Tuesday and Friday when we learn about our solar system. Even my 5 year old is starting to understand the solar system and this educational toy has been a great help in learning about rotate and revolve.

I highly recommend you give this a try, especially if you are a home educator or a parent who just wants to spend some time with your kids learning about the solar system. For the price, really what do you have to loose but a little time having fun painting it and putting it together with your children!?!?!"

Secondly, it is not all that sturdy. The set is very rickety and the planets don't stay together well. Maybe after painting they stay closed, but we didn't get that far. The planets kept coming apart, and after a day and a half various halves were missing and unable to be recovered. Eventually we had to just throw the set away."

Markousis",2016/10/20,"This is the best tool kit for the asking price on Amazon, better than the Tamiya starter set by leaps and bounds. The side cutters are not the best quality, but are comfortable to hold and cut very well while sharp, however I suspect they will dull quickly. They are a good first pair for beginners and will last until you decide to upgrade to a nicer pair.
The Tamiya set only includes one set of flimsy angled tweezers. The 2 tweezers, angled and straight, are very pointy and have a quality heft to them.
The screwdrivers are nice and long with good handles, well suited to smaller jobs like gunpla.
The pen knife is very nice, smaller blade than xacto and a very comfortable tapered handle. It is very comfortable in the hand. Included are a small vial of replacement blades, they look like snapped off sections of a retractable box cutter blade, which coincidentally comes with the Tamiya set. Personally I find that type unsuited to modeling due to the blade not locking in place.
Three files are included, a flat, a rounded and an angled. These coupled with the sanding sticks (6 different grits!) will ensure no gate nubs remain on your finished kit.

The last inclusion is a humble piece of yellow plastic with angled edges. No one understands it's true purpose, but you will find it indispensable on the journey you will soon embark upon. Hold it fast against your breast, for it is the only thing that will keep you safe when the horrors come to call. Heed my warning or ye be lost to the darkness.
Like I said though, it's a great set."

It includes:

- Three metal files of differing shapes/angles
- Three sanding boards of differing grit levels
- Two tweezers (bent and straight)
- One hobby knife plus refill blades
- Part separator
- Two screwdrivers (phillips, flathead)
- One pair of clippers
- Plastic case

The clippers are not the greatest, and I've noticed a slight dulling after just three HG kits, but they're far from being obsolete. The three sanding boards come in three perfect grit levels for me. Since they're unlabeled, I don't know exactly what number they are, but they're a nice selection of coarse, medium and fine grit that work well getting rid of those nubs and seams. The knife is comfortable, and has a textured grip to prevent slipping. The blades are easily swappable, and I was well into work on my third kit before I had to swap one. generally find the metal files to be too coarse for my needs and preferences, and tend to only use them in rare instances. The tweezers are really nice, with very thin tips to get into small crevices. Of course, I mostly just use them for sticker application. The part separator is one of those items I thankfully haven't had to use more than once or twice so far, but worked very well. I haven't used the screwdrivers at all yet, but they don't seem particularly remarkable in any way - good, or bad. The plastic case is nice but I wish it were a little bigger. It fits all of the included items just fine, but doesn't leave much room for anything else you may want to add.

The only reason I may suggest going with a different kit over this one might be to get one that includes a cutting mat, but you can pick one of those up separately.."

You'd fairly get a good amount of things, 12 in all including the box (which i like the most). So ill break it down with my experience on this tool set.

-First thing is the 3 files with the red handles arent your normal files. They have this weird coat on them and dont look like files at all. Either way I thought id tested them on the feet of the kit im currently building (00 Exia MG). It scuffed the paint off the paint as i was sanding down the excess nib with the file, thus im going to never use it again.

-The nippers that come with it are alright, but im considering upgrading to the GP nippers (Gundam planet). They are suppose to rival the god hands and the price point is a fair amount cheaper too. Gundam planet nippers are $35 (popular choice) vs God hands $45-50 (plus theyre not always in stock). So my advice is to buy better nippers and do research for the one that you'd like. (invest your money in better nippers and you'll see your investment do its work).

-Moving onto the modeler's knife or X-acto (whichever you want to call it, either is fine). Its not all that great either. The blades arent really sharp and its flimsy. Plus the rotator near the grip unscrews itself making the blade lose out of its housing. I'd have to check each time i scrape off the excess when i cut it off the runner. When i put down the modeler's knife, it rolls off of every surface (i may be exaggerating a little bit, but the damn thing doesn't stay put the first moment you place it down lol). Its becoming a nuisance. My suggestion is to get a better X-acto knife with better replacement blades like the Tamiya pro modelers knife $16 (which is what im going to buy next as well).

-So all in all, i dont use much of the tool set that they provided within this set. The biggest plus to me is that when you do buy this tool set, you'd have a nice transparent box to put other things/upgraded tools in. You can also hang it too :D

Pros:
-3 sanding bars are good
-2 Tweezers
-1 part separator (yellow piece)
-1 box (the case the whole tool set came in)

Cons:
-Bad files
-Flimsy modelers knife and replacement blades
-Nippers are alright"

The only two complaints I really have are:

1) The nipper blades are really thick, with what seems like a 45 degree angle on the blade. They work but it's hard to sometimes get them in tight places around the sprus.

2) The sanding sticks don't have a ""buffing"" stick so there is no way, with this kit alone, to get a nice shiny plastic finish again after sanding. This doesn't affect me because I paint my models anyway, however when my son tried using them he was unable to use these to sand down without adding that buffing stick."

Many times you can find a set of multiple models for a much lower individual price. Some are just harder than others. A few considered ""easy"" on metal earths web site have been harder than ones considered ""challenging"" or ""expert"". I like the harder ones. Spending $7 to $10 on a model that I put together in less than 20 minutes sucks. Having the proper tools is a must. A pair of small wire cutters (I purchased the Hakko CHP-170 for less than $5), a small pair of pliers or two (I purchased at Hobby Lobby in the jewelry section), a set of small electronic/watch repair screwdrivers (to bend the tabs or to take apart when I mess up), and since my eyes are not what they used to be, a head magnifier or cheap reading glasses you can get at any dollar store. I search around the house for things that may help. Round pencils, small wood dowel, markers of different sizes, anything that fits the shape I need.

Many of the pieces in the models are very small, and the tabs to be bent or twisted are hard to get to or manipulate. But isn't that the idea of a model? With all Metal Earth models, take your time and if something doesn't seem to fit then stop, backtrack, and look and see if you missed something or have a wrong piece in the wrong place. The instructions are easy to read, but on the more than 50 models I have put together only 2 or 3 have had an error in the instructions. I have learned that if you come to a spot in the instructions that is hard to understand then slightly twist the tabs. This allows for a much easier time taking apart. You can then bend or twist the tabs when you know it is correct. The tabs can be bent several times before they break (I can't seem to put together any of them without messing up and having to take a piece or two off to correct)."

Do not give this to a child or anyone who has a short attention span or gets frustrated easily. They are fragile before you start building, during the building process and after. The metal bends very easily and care must be taken to properly shape those pieces that require shaping. The right tools are essential. You will need fine needle nose pliers, tweezers, straight edges for bending, a shear cutter to remove the pieces from the metal sheet and a good magnifying lamp. The effort will be worth it."

My grandfather absolutely loved it and marveled at the detail and intricate parts.

A lot of folks are complaining about how hard the model is or how unintuitive it is. To respond to their first complaint: duh. It is a model. If you want something that is easy to put together, get a tube of tinker toys or legos. The whole idea behind a model like this is to have something that is challenging, takes time, and when you are done, you have something exquisite. The model was meant for adults, not five year olds.

To respond to their second complaint: The instructions are a bit cryptic at first, but on closer inspection, they are actually quite simple. The instruction look like something IKEA cooked up - simple, a tiny bit cryptic, but very effective. If you take the time to read the legend, the instructions are easy as pie."

Had to stop because I realized I needed much better flush cutters. After buying a couple of MUCH needed tools (magnifying light stand, FLUSH side cutters) I restarted building. The small round pieces are not impossible to do correctly BUT be warned, you should have a set of metal dowels or drill blanks or gage pins to help roll/form the circular parts.

 This will take me at LEAST 10 hours to complete (my best estimate). I am a skilled tool and die maker and I am used to working under a microscope. I have nearly every tool imaginable at my disposal, but I needed that magnifying stand, these are VERY small parts indeed and my 49 yr old eyes wouldn't do it without help!!

 I think a dentist or surgeon would enjoy this model, needs a lot of care and precision to make. This model is NOTHING like a plastic model. Soem basic knowledge of steel is helpful. The stainless steel parts are very ductile (soft). The sheet is annealed, so it bend very easily. this is good AND bad sometimes. It is a bit tricky to bend one thing and NOT make bends where you don't want them, you need some long nose small pliers with NO serrations in the jaws. GET A REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT!!

I include a few pictures of how far I've gotten. The little radiator cap was not too bad, but the headlights were difficult to do nicely. Like I said get some metal pins/dowels to wrap around to pre-form and it makes it easier. Use a small abrasive stone or a Dremel and diamond point to remove any flash that can interfere with fitting to other pieces."

So I gave it to my hubby for Christmas. He loved doing these! I bought 2 different models, this one Model T car and a tractor . The instructions were clear and easy to understand, we found using tweezers and needle nose pliers were the easiest way to bend the tabs, to make the parts. They turned out really cool looking, when he got them done! It's amazing that a flat metal piece can turn into the objects like this! Awesome. I will be buying more!"

Rickter",2016/06/10,"This was my first metal model and I really enjoyed putting it together. I found it to be the right level of challenge for me -- not too easy and not too hard. Others might find it more challenging than they expect/want.

Some cautions/caveats:
* Some of the pieces are extremely tiny. It's very easy to drop a small piece and then spend the next 15 minutes trying to find it under the couch. It's a good idea to work on a piece of black fabric, so pieces are easy to find if you drop one.
* Don't even think about trying to put this together without at least a pair of needle-nose pliers. Tweezers, wire-cutters, and a tool that lets you bend the metal into curves are also very helpful.
* Follow the instructions closely and don't rush. Trust me, once you attach a piece, you don't want to have to detach it.
* There are a few points in where the instructions aren't as detailed as they could be. Notably, assembling the wheels and attaching them to the chassis has to be done in a set order that the instructions don't sufficient emphasize -- you may want to attach the inside wheel-rim to the tire/outside wheel-rim before attaching the entire wheel to the chassis, but it's important to attach the inside wheel-rim to the chassis before attaching the rest of the wheel to the inside rim. The instructions should make that clear, but they don't.
* This took me about three hours of work to assemble and the result looks very nice!"

But it turned out extremely well in the end.

It was a bit surprising, because it did look a little daunting at first. There's a lot of small parts. Many parts you have to bend into shape. And it's got it's share of fragile parts. But everything on the model fit together the first time, and I never felt like I had to struggle with some problem parts. Only issue I had was with the tires, and that was just because they are pretty thin, and bending the tabs into place kept warping them a little. Though they reshaped just fine.

I'd say this kit took me a little over 2 hours as a result of the many small parts. The build wasn't fun per second, since there was a lot of tediously small parts. But it's not as difficult as it looks.

The finished product looked quite nice. It's one of the best finished products I've made in the Metal Earth model line. Nice enough that one of my friends kinda locked in on it the first time he saw it, and I pretty much had to gift it to him at that point. Not that I mind, since I already have enough model kits of various origins on display at my house.

Overall, it's a great kit that can be bought for a little less than $8. And while I would not recommend this ad a beginner model kit, it isn't as difficult as it looks. Maybe pick this one up if you've done a couple of these kits already."

The instructions are straight forward, the decals are the normal Monogram-Revell quality, a little thick but fairly decent. The decals allow for two different paint schemes, either olive drab over neutral grey or an all natural aluminum finish. A nice brochure with photos and tips on how to build a diorama is also included if one desires to make a diorama to display the finished model. Plenty of aftermarket decals and other accessories for the B-17 are avialable through online hobby retailers like Squadron.com, MeteorProductions.com and SprueBros.com, to name a few. I built my model just using a set of aftermarket decals, with some hand crafted details and an airbrushed finished paint job. The completed model more than met my expectations. Most of the pieces fit together very nicely. I had to apply some putty along the bottom edge of the wing to fuselage joints and to one edge of both waist gunner windows.

The bomb bay doors are molded shut and if you want them open to display the bombs on the bomb racks, you will have to cut them open which is not a job for a beginner but and advanced modeler.

I love aircraft. I also live in NC. One of the reviewers talked about how bad the model was, the directions, etc. This is a great little model. The instructions are a full eight pages, plus four pages of how to make it more realistic. I agree it is not for a young model builder. But how many 8 yrs old are going to build a Wright Flyer from 1903 without guidance from an adult. The instructions also state this is a re-release of a 40 yr old model.
One of his big complaints was the flashing and sprues. FOR the record and this will help model makers just starting out understand the sprue and tabs.
When you look at any model you'll see the little round pieces of plastic attached to the parts, you will need to trim these carefully. Look at their location. They have an EXTREMELY important task in life. They are contact points for the the ejector pins within the injection machine mold. The ejector pins push against them pushing the ""tree"" out of the molding cavity. You cannot push against the actual part because the part is (1) still hot and you would scar or mark it with the stainless steel pins, (2) the ejector pin bosses on the sprues are located at stress and weak points that could break. The more intricate and thin the part the more ejector bosses.
Don't be miss-led by a non verified reviewer. I've put models together for over 50 years and this one blew me away when I first opened the box. One of the best detailed and instructed I've bought ever. It will take me a while to put together, because I want it right. but for $9.99. OUTSTANDING purchase."

If you are a parent that bought this because you thought it would be a cool prop for your child's Wright Brothers project at school, buy a pre-assembed model or print something from the interwebs.

Frankly, I work full time and I am busy. I have too many things I want to do on the weekend--building models is not one of them. This isn't snap-tite or a simple toy car; it takes a solid 8+ hours even if you don't paint it and cut or sand off all the little tooling marks. Then, there is the thread--the thread is a giant pain. You have to pull tiny thread through all the little holes to simulate the rigging. But, the holes aren't big enough. So, you have to bore out all the holes with a straight pin. Then, the thread won't go though unless you burn the end of the thread. Then, the thread will be too big to go through the hole. Repeat this process dozens of times and you begin to get the idea.

I don't know what the parts that connect the upper and lower wings together are called (beams, spars?). You are supposed rig these together with thread, but it doesn't really attach cleanly. Perhaps, you are supposed to clean these parts out with a hobby knife? I didn't really know or care. But, because I didn't care or ever figure it out, I had to manually glue the thread at each point and I could never make it look taut.

Again, if you like models, this is cheap and challenging. If you are doing this for a project, buy something pre-assembled and spend the time saved doing something you enjoy."

It says on the package ""moderate"" difficulty level and was intended for a child aged 12 years and up. I'm 17 so I thought it would be a piece of cake. Not so. When I opened the kit I was daunted by the hundred or so teeny-tiny pieces, some of which I almost lost because they were less than half the size of my pinkie nail. The instructions themselves give hardly any clues as to what materials you need to buy. However, the ""Tips for Building a Diorama"" can be helpful about what kind of plastic cement and paints you will need. The total cost of materials (including a hobby knife) was around eighteen dollars--pretty cheap I would say. However, I was not ready for what was in store. The plastic pieces are quite flimsy, and on my last day working on it I broke an important part of the plane. I was nevertheless able to painstakingly cement it back together (sort of), but the model needs more attention than a 12 years old could lend. When I got to the rigging step of the process, things got even more challenging. You need tweezers (and the sharp eyes of an eagle) to be able to gently coax a gray piece of thread through a hole smaller than the eye of a needle! I spent at least five hours on the rigging alone, sometimes getting so frustrated and red in the face that I had to stop or I thought I would throw the model on the floor in exasperation. The lengths of thread that the instructions say you need are wildly incorrect; when they say you need 16"", 10"" or so would suffice. While this may be a good thing (as it allows you to easily tie knots), it initially made me nervous, thinking that I was assembling it incorrectly. All told, I spent about 9 days building it, working on it at least three hours a day. A more experienced model-builder could probably have done it in an afternoon, but as a novice I put in way more time than I had expected. Nevertheless, building the ""Wright Flyer"" really made me love assembling model airplanes. Despite all the blood, sweat, and tears--or perhaps because of it--it is a truly satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you step back and look upon the plane that you built with your own two hands."

I had a broken piece of plastic and couldn't find any of this smelly cement anywhere where I live in Maryland. Perhaps there are local laws about using this stuff because of the fumes--I do remember stories of children sniffing glue, and I think this is what they sniffed. So do exercise caution about breathing it.

It worked. After I'd tried three or four other locally purchased products, this welded a plastic bowl that had broken. It's been in our family for 50 years and we didn't want to throw it out. Now it holds water again and is back to daily duty as a mixing bowl."

Also great for classroom settings - I have used it with small groups of preschoolers and they have a lot of fun with it, and so much easier cleanup compared to playdough.

So lightweight, like nothing added. I covered three hooks with one package. To color, I used food color and dabbed the food color container to the compound and then worked the color in. Adding more or other colors to create a variety of colors.

Recommended by a crocheter who built up her favorite crochet hook years ago and it's still going. Actually, if you mess up, just put it and a bit of water in a small mason jar or a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let it sit until it rehydrates and start over.

If you do cover crochet hooks, let it dry air for 48 hours or more. To dry faster, put it near a window and let the sun warm it to dry fully to the interior. If you want to mold it to your hand grip, give it a squeeze before it's completely dry (the interior will collapse a bit to shape. Then allow to dry.

I don't know if any protection needs made to crochet hooks that usually won't be near water. So far, so good.

FYI: This is not sturdy enough to use when stitching Tapestry Crochet which requires a tighter stitch. It will break from your grip. For Tapestry crochet build up of hooks, use polymer clay (the stuff you bake). Search Google for m
any tutorials for building up hooks with polymer clay."

When you create something out of it the resulting piece ""dries"" in that it can no longer be re-shaped but it retains a strange foamy feel to it. It never hardens. We had bought this so kids could make ""fossil"" impressions to take home. It worked but was fairly lackluster. A true trying clay would produce better detail and not turn into a weird foam disk with a faint shell impression on it. This make be good for some projects you can imagine but it was far from ""magic"" for us."

Suffice to say the trees looked great and held together well, although a little of the ""foliage"" fell off with handling, but not much considering.

After my daughters project is graded, I plan to pilfer some of the trees to use with RPG miniature diaramas and bases. The size range means I can use them as anything from tall trees to bushes depending on the miniature.

They're miniature tress made of plastic. If you're in the neighborhood for something to spice up your board games, then definitely buy these. I bought them specifically for Warhammer 40k matches, and they're serving the emperor well. I bought plastic, figure bases to go alongside these, and drilled tiny divots on top of them. By doing this, I was able to super glue the pointy ends of these on, and now they're stable as physically possible on the field of battle!

They're really good quality for what you buy. Up close, they retain their natural look, however, you will see that they're plastic. (Because they're plastic and you should expect that.) There's not a lot of options to move around branches here, and that was great for shipping. By doing this, they didn't fall apart getting here and that's all I wanted to begin with. Tree figures that don't fall apart. Just don't play with them, and I'm sure that you'll have them for years to come. Why I say you shouldn't play with them is because the leaves are the plastic you'll see on fake pine trees for Christmas celebration. I've had long experiences with these, and I know how many petals decide to just fall off. I actually started playing with a few to see if they would, but they didn't. I'm sure they'll be fine if all of them survived transit with nary a scratch. Just treat them well and they should return the favor, as with all things.

TL;DR: Use these for a hobby and expect them to be great, plastic models."

They arrived in a small container (roughly 6""x6""x4"") which means that they were pressed together inside. That made some of the trees either bent or pushed the branches into the trunk. I was concerned at first but they quickly relaxed and assumed their normal tree-like shape. Once settled, the various trees looked great. I'm using them for a miniatures game and they fill the background woods roll perfectly. I'm not sure how it would have changed the look but an epoxy coating or even hairspray might have been a nice touch.
The packaging wasn't an issue as mentioned above but I have noticed that the ""leaves"" tend to fall off when handled. I'm sure this is fine when simply used for mock-ups but as discussed, I move these around often. Would have rated 5 otherwise."

A couple of the trunks and branches were a little bent, but still very use-able (otherwise would have been 5 stars). The amount of leaves ""shedding"" off the trees seems alarming, but I certainly don't have any noticeable bald spots. I was actually able to save the shedded parts and use them as underbrush on my new bases. I think shedding is only natural with these sorts of minis, and once the loose stuff has fallen, the rest seems to be staying on fine. I may trying spraying some to see if it helps
Here's a picture of them with some standard 1"" miniatures for scale. I haven't made bases for the smaller trees yet. Please note that I made the bases and painted the black stripes on the ""birch"" trees, so they are not accurate to how the product arrives."

The kit was at an okay price and looked to be of a decent quality, but the reality is much different.

We'll start with the cutting board. I am used to a store-bought, self healing cutting board and assumed that the one included in this bundle would be similar; alas, it is not. It is about as pliable as shale and incredibly heavy for as small as it is. In addition to that, I am legitimately worried that it will break a hobby knife blade if one would end up slipping and cutting into it.

Next are the cutting tools. This kit includes a hobby knife, an extra set of blades, the cheapest box cutter on earth and a pair of small cutting scissors. These tools are probably my biggest disappointment of the whole kit. The hobby knife is very flimsy, the scissors are all but useless and not the same as the ones pictured, and the box cutter is only good for breaking down the box that this stuff came in for recycling.

Also included are some tweezers and a basic metal ruler, which are useful and are of an okay quality, but find limited use for a beginner builder.

The files and sanding blocks are the only thing I can give a real thumbs up to, because they seem sturdy and are some of the most important tools in a builder's kit. Please note, however, that I have not used them and cannot say in 100% certainty that they're effective/good.

Overall, my opinion of this kit is simple: spend a few extra bucks and piece together your own set of tools. The quality of these items are subpar at best and incomplete. One would be better off using coupons at your local hobby/crafts store to buy the knife, cutting mat and files; and you could also purchase a set of cheap nippers, which are omitted from this kit for whatever strange reason.

I will update this review after my brother tries these tools and gives me feedback."

I don't have any others to compare them to.
They're a good fit for larger wargame figures, 28mm (heroclix, Reaper) if that helps. I'll be using the remainder from the project for civilian figures in my games.
The figures have a vaguely 50's feel to the clothing style, mostly on the women, but there's nothing specific that would limit them to any point in time. They paint well after Gesso priming. I made a number of changes to them using green stuff, and it took just fine. I did not need to cut any of the figures.
The plastic is hard, it files well. There were a few mold lines, mostly in the crooks of the bent arm figures, and a small flash point on the tops of the heads, but nothing excessive on any of them.
The figures are very nice, and excellent for the price."

This is completely different from a 3D puzzles. Make sure you know what you are getting into when you buy this! The metal sheeting is very thin and easy to bend and break. This is more along the lines of a complex metal model than a puzzle. Freeing the individual pieces is hard because they are very delicate and detailed.

The first perk of this particular model is that is has a fair amount of customization available out of the box, with instructions and decals for three different schemes: American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers), RAF circa 1941, and US Army Air Corps circa 1940. I put the kit together in about three days time, but it could be put together sooner, and would make a great kit to do with a child. The decals were also top notch, and the glue instantly bonded unlike some other models I've had to deal with. The decals also molded exceptionally well to the model, and the rivets and panel lines were clearly seen through the decal even without using the solutions some use when applying them. The fuselage and wings are exceptionally detailed with clear panel lines and rivets, and the fit for most of the parts is snug and seamless. Additionally, the landing fear is stable and strong, with none of the weak fits and layouts of other models. I painted the kit with a combination of acrylic and enamel paints in the USAAC livery, and it turned out better than I had originally hoped.

However, there are also flaws with the model. The fit between the wings and fuselage is loose (same between the engine cowling and fuselage to a lesser extent), and will require putty if gaps bother you. The wing flaps too are liable to simply fall out of place (they're on a hinge sort of system in the wing), which is fine if you want to simulate a parked P-40, but would be annoying if anyone wanted to hang it. Finally, the plastic itself is very thin in many pieces and makes fitting the fuselage together with the cockpit intact a challenge to put it mildly. Thankfully the model is durable despite how thin the plastic is, and stood up well to the creative means I had to employ to get the fuselage to fit together. A final con against it, although rather minor, are the gun sights. This model features bead sights mounted on the fuselage fore of the canopy, which honestly is a nice touch. The con is that the holes in the fuselage are about twice the size they need to be to fit the sights themselves, and will require some patience as well as manually holding them to the fuselage until your glue cures enough for them to stay upright on their own. Otherwise the front bead sight will fall straight through, and it will take some creative shaking to get it to come out through the flaps.

Finally, I purchased the kit for $9.99 with prime shipping, and actually got it the next day. So kudos to Amazon on that, it was a great model at a great price.

Pros:
Excellent Price.
Clear and unambiguous instructions.
Excellent customization.
Stable and sturdy landing gear.
Great overall detail, it authentically looks like a P-40 should.
Rotating propeller that is neither too loose nor does it get stuck.

Cons:
Loose and/or tricky fits between the fuselage and wings, fuselage and engine cowling, and fuselage halves.
Thin plastic in much of the model makes fitting various parts even tougher.
Holes for the bead sights are much too large.
Getting the wing flaps to stay in position can be tricky at best.

Overall rating:
8.5/10"

Dwyer",2015/06/24,"I've grown away from aircraft modeling, recently finding a great niche in ship kits. But I wanted a P-40 and P-51 to round out my WWII classic american fighters collection, and this was readily available and I didn't care to do too much to it. I did research, didn't follow the directions or the paint scheme, and added wires, folded up the landing gear, and perched it in-flight on a stand with brass tubing.

All that being a mission accomplished, this was a hard build to get into. The obvious choice for decaling is the AVG, which would make this a Tomahwak IIB, not really an American spec P-40B. Typical Revell inaccuracies, and I understand it's dated. BUT the fit problems on this peculiarly thinly molded kit was ridiculous. Maybe I've just spoiled myself, but there was no real surface contact in all the places it was desperately needed. The nose of the plane is a complete cluster of seams. I was careful in my clamping, and the cockpit and wings onto the fuselage didn't give me significant problems like others have said, but fitting the fuselage halves and the nose gun fixtures and basically all the landing gear doors front and back were more than aggravating enough to counteract that upside.

I do appreciate that the drop tank hole made an excellent spot to mount it on the tubing.

Overall, the money spent on a newer kit would be well worth it. There were more than a couple times that I regretted purchasing from Revell again after the past taught me to steer clear, and I'm not one to write off a kit for poor quality if the subject matter is worth it. I enjoy the challenges of more technical kits and I knew going in that filler was going to be a must, and I feel putting in that time and effort on any kit is always worth it, but this one definitely pushed my stance on that.

Back to ships for me. Buy a different brand P-40."

I also have more patience and better skill, and enjoy it more now. I decided to start with the P-40B, because I was always fascinated with planes, and the monster teeth on the P-40.

The kit is very simple, but not so easy it is like a kids toy. You can build 3 different versions, I went with the ""Flying Tigers"" version. It took me about 3 to 4 days, for I took my time and snipped each part well, sanded and fitted prior to cementing, and then waited for the glue to dry. I pre-painted many pieces, and then re-touched later on.

Make sure you get a ""military flats"" acrylic paint kit. They should be ""FLAT"", not ""glossy""; and be browns, greens, etc., and get a nice small brush. Also, you will need an X-acto knife, sandpaper and glue. Get the kit that comes with it all. Very fun if you go slow and have patience. Well worth the price."

Fuselage halves fit was awful...worst I've ever seen. Took lots of putty to make it even reasonably right. Same with the wings, and those moveable flaps are a joke.

We used model railroad snow to add glue to the trees to finish the effect and were able to plunge the trunks directly into a styrofoam based without any gluing.

Suffice to say the trees looked great and held together well, although a little of the ""foliage"" fell off with handling, but not much considering.

After my daughters project is graded, I plan to pilfer some of the trees to use with RPG miniature diaramas and bases. The size range means I can use them as anything from tall trees to bushes depending on the miniature.

They're miniature tress made of plastic. If you're in the neighborhood for something to spice up your board games, then definitely buy these. I bought them specifically for Warhammer 40k matches, and they're serving the emperor well. I bought plastic, figure bases to go alongside these, and drilled tiny divots on top of them. By doing this, I was able to super glue the pointy ends of these on, and now they're stable as physically possible on the field of battle!

They're really good quality for what you buy. Up close, they retain their natural look, however, you will see that they're plastic. (Because they're plastic and you should expect that.) There's not a lot of options to move around branches here, and that was great for shipping. By doing this, they didn't fall apart getting here and that's all I wanted to begin with. Tree figures that don't fall apart. Just don't play with them, and I'm sure that you'll have them for years to come. Why I say you shouldn't play with them is because the leaves are the plastic you'll see on fake pine trees for Christmas celebration. I've had long experiences with these, and I know how many petals decide to just fall off. I actually started playing with a few to see if they would, but they didn't. I'm sure they'll be fine if all of them survived transit with nary a scratch. Just treat them well and they should return the favor, as with all things.

TL;DR: Use these for a hobby and expect them to be great, plastic models."

They arrived in a small container (roughly 6""x6""x4"") which means that they were pressed together inside. That made some of the trees either bent or pushed the branches into the trunk. I was concerned at first but they quickly relaxed and assumed their normal tree-like shape. Once settled, the various trees looked great. I'm using them for a miniatures game and they fill the background woods roll perfectly. I'm not sure how it would have changed the look but an epoxy coating or even hairspray might have been a nice touch.
The packaging wasn't an issue as mentioned above but I have noticed that the ""leaves"" tend to fall off when handled. I'm sure this is fine when simply used for mock-ups but as discussed, I move these around often. Would have rated 5 otherwise."

A couple of the trunks and branches were a little bent, but still very use-able (otherwise would have been 5 stars). The amount of leaves ""shedding"" off the trees seems alarming, but I certainly don't have any noticeable bald spots. I was actually able to save the shedded parts and use them as underbrush on my new bases. I think shedding is only natural with these sorts of minis, and once the loose stuff has fallen, the rest seems to be staying on fine. I may trying spraying some to see if it helps
Here's a picture of them with some standard 1"" miniatures for scale. I haven't made bases for the smaller trees yet. Please note that I made the bases and painted the black stripes on the ""birch"" trees, so they are not accurate to how the product arrives."

It is small with a very durable fin system. It is not a difficult rocket to make and it will take you about an hour to make it - depending on glue drying time. Everything about it is designed to minimize weight without sacrificing strength so it can go fast and high.
It has a streamer rather than a parachute which is a good thing because of the height it attains. With a parachute it could very well sail off quite a distance from your launch zone.
I like the solid fin system. They are stronger than normal. I found the recommended painting scheme to be a bit too much, even though I did it by the suggested way. You might just want to spray paint the whole thing one solid color.
Nice little rocket, cheap and fast.
Remember that this is just a rocket. You still have to purchase engines, wadding and a launcher if you are just starting out in the hobby."

This is a fun boat, but there are a couple of tips that might be helpful. The only directions are on the bottom of the box. Don't forget to look for the little bag containing the two cannons that install at the stern near the helicopter. Also, the directions describe two vents, one at the rear, forward of the helicopter, and one at the bow. These are to release vapor after use. I haven't seen the need for this, but you may wonder what those are for. To the rear of the helicopter are two sensors. Place your thumb over those and the remote will operate the boat for the purpose of testing. Otherwise, when the boat is in the water, the boat will operate. The remote has two controls, one for each propeller. Both forward and the boat goes straight. Using only one will steer the boat, however, one forward and the other in reverse will make it do tight turns. It's very responsive. Also, it seems fairly watertight, but I did notice some water coming out of the stern at those two sensors. So after I use it, I tilt it up to see if any water will drain. The battery does not have any charging indication, so I don't know how long it takes to fully charge. The directions say 5-6 hours. The directions also say it will operate for 20 minutes. I suppose that's continuous use, which means longer otherwise. I've played with it for nearly 40 minutes. There is no low battery warning, but when the speed begins to get slower, there's still plenty of charge to bring it in. I've not run out of range. It's quite enjoyable - a fun boat!"

But it really does come with most everything you need as a starter kit except the consumables. Here's what you'll need to fly:

Glue
Scissors
Pencil
A small sharp knife (like an exacto)
A 9V battery
A pack of standard Estes motors (I suggest: A8-5, B6-6, C6-7)
A pack of igniters (usually comes with the Estes motors)
A pack wadding (special tissue-like paper that goes between the motor and the chute)

My son and I were able to assemble everything in an hour or two (using gel crazy glue for fast drying). It was really easy if you carefully read the directions.

WARNING TO CALIFORNIANS: Please, please, PLEASE be aware of the laws in CA for launching rockets. You need explicit permission of your local fire marshal and the property owner as well as meeting a bunch of other laws. In practice that means you'll probably need to find a rocket club with launching privileges to be able to launch legally. Many launch illegally without a problem, but please note it is a $1000 fine for EACH launch if a cop decides to nail you. There are horror stories of unaware parents getting multi-thousand dollar fines as a cop watched as they launched a handful of times without incident from the local park. It's up to you if you want to take the risk, but I'd hate for people to be unaware of how pricey the risk they are taking could be."

I have a 7 and 5 year old girls who absolutely loved it. Putting it together was relatively simple. I supervised the construction and it took them about two hours to put it together over a couple of days. The 7 year old did the bulk of the work and the only reason we spread the work over a two-day period is because we had to wait for the paint to dry (cheap spray paint for our first project). I did a little research beforehand and purchased the engines and wadding at the same time we purchased the kit, so we had everything available when it was time to launch. For about $50 bucks total we had a great time. The Estes website offers lesson plans free of charge which enabled me to confidently discuss some basic concepts with the girls. They really enjoyed it! Moreover, we set up assigned launch positions, rotated them around, and they loved the entire launch production. We used two different engines and both worked great. Two A8-3 engines to start out, then we switched to a B6-2. They loved both. Naturally the B6-2 was a bit more exciting due to the extra altitude achieved. As a dad who is gently nudging his girls towards STEM related subjects, this was great. We spend quality time building it, and had a “blast” launching it!"

The Porta-Pad II can be expanded with a 3/16"" MAXI rod for launching mid-size rockets, but the Astron II CANNOT, meaning the Astron II launch pad can't grow with you. The part number on the package (001427) did not change. Still a good kit, but not nearly the deal it used to be."
